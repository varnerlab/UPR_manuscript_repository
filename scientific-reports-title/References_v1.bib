	Abstract = {Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) belongs to the ATF/CREB (activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP response element binding protein) family of basic region-leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factors, which have the consensus binding site cAMP responsive element (CRE). ATF4 has numerous dimerization partners. ATF4 is induced by stress signals including anoxia/hypoxia, endoplasmic reticulum stress, amino acid deprivation, and oxidative stress. ATF4 expression is regulated transcriptionally, translationally via the PERK pathway of eIF2alpha phosphorylation, and posttranslationally by phosphorylation, which targets ATF4 to proteasomal degradation. ATF4 regulates the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress, amino acid synthesis, differentiation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Transgenic studies have demonstrated ATF4 to be involved in hematopoiesis, lens and skeletal development, fertility, proliferation, differentiation, and long-term memory. ATF4 expression is upregulated in cancer. Since ATF4 is induced by tumour microenvironmental factors, and regulates processes relevant to cancer progression, it might serve as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.},

	Abstract = {Androgen ablation therapy is currently the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, androgen ablation fails to permanently arrest cancer progression. As androgens like testosterone are withdrawn, prostate cancer cells lose their androgen sensitivity and begin to proliferate without hormone growth factors. In this study, we constructed and analyzed a mathematical model of the integration between hormone growth factor signaling, androgen receptor activation, and the expression of cyclin D and Prostate-Specific Antigen in human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The objective of the study was to investigate which signaling systems were important in the loss of androgen dependence. The model was formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations which described 212 species and 384 interactions, including both the mRNA and protein levels for key species. An ensemble approach was chosen to constrain model parameters and to estimate the impact of parametric uncertainty on model predictions. Model parameters were identified using 14 steady-state and dynamic LNCaP data sets taken from literature sources. Alterations in the rate of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase expression was sufficient to capture varying levels of androgen dependence. Analysis of the model provided insight into the importance of network components as a function of androgen dependence. The importance of androgen receptor availability and the MAPK/Akt signaling axes was independent of androgen status. Interestingly, androgen receptor availability was important even in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Translation became progressively more important in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Further analysis suggested a positive synergy between the MAPK and Akt signaling axes and the translation of key proliferative markers like cyclin D in androgen-independent cells. Taken together, the results support the targeting of both the Akt and MAPK pathways. Moreover, the analysis suggested that direct targeting of the translational machinery, specifically eIF4E, could be efficacious in androgen-independent prostate cancers.},

	Abstract = {The role of mechanistic modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether uncertain models could be used to understand how a network responds to a therapeutic intervention. As a proof of concept, we modeled and analyzed the response of the human coagulation cascade to recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) and prothrombin (fII) addition in normal and hemophilic plasma. An ensemble of parametrically uncertain human coagulation models was developed (N = 437). Each model described the time evolution of 193 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 301 interactions under quiescent flow. The 467 unknown model parameters were estimated, using multiobjective optimization, from published in vitro coagulation studies. The model ensemble was validated using published in vitro thrombin measurements and thrombin measurements taken from coronary artery disease patients. Sensitivity analysis was then used to rank-order the importance of model parameters as a function of experimental or physiological conditions. A novel strategy for the systematic comparison of ranks identified a family of fX/FXa and fII/FIIa interactions that became more sensitive with decreasing fVIII/fIX. The fragility of these interactions was preserved following the addition of exogenous rFVIIa and fII. This suggested that exogenous rFVIIa did not alter the qualitative operation of the cascade. Rather, exogenous rFVIIa and fII took advantage of existing fluid and interfacial fX/FXa and fII/FIIa sensitivity to restore normal coagulation in low fVIII/fIX conditions. The proposed rFVIIa mechanism of action was consistent with experimental literature not used in model training. Thus, we demonstrated that an ensemble of uncertain models could unravel key facets of the mechanism of action of a focused intervention. Whereas the current study was limited to coagulation, perhaps the general strategy used could be extended to other molecular networks relevant to human health.},

	Abstract = {The role that mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology will play in molecular medicine and clinical development remains uncertain. In this study, mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the working hypothesis that mechanistic models of human cascades, despite model uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, and that these sensitive mechanisms could serve as therapeutic targets. We tested our working hypothesis by screening a model of the well-studied coagulation cascade, developed and validated from literature. The predicted sensitive mechanisms were then compared with the treatment literature. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 published datasets generated from two different quiescent in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation profiles in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across all trials. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which measure the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated using a Monte Carlo strategy. In the absence of anticoagulants, fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found to be fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. Both anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants; for example, anti-fX/FXa inhibitors have FDA approval for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and as an initial treatment for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence is reviewed supporting the prediction that fIX/FIXa activity is robust. When taken together, these results support our working hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of assembly of polypeptide chains destined for secretion or routing into various subcellular compartments. It also regulates cellular responses to stress and intracellular Ca(2+) levels. A variety of toxic insults can result in ER stress that ultimately leads to apoptosis. Apoptosis is initiated by the activation of members of the caspase family and serves as a central mechanism in the cell death process. The present study was carried out to determine the role of caspases in triggering ER stress-induced cell death. Treatment of cells with ER stress inducers such as brefeldin-A or thapsigargin induces the expression of caspase-12 protein and also leads to translocation of cytosolic caspase-7 to the ER surface. Caspase-12, like most other members of the caspase family, requires cleavage of the prodomain to activate its proapoptotic form. Caspase-7 associates with caspase-12 and cleaves the prodomain to generate active caspase-12, resulting in increased cell death. We propose that any cellular insult that causes prolonged ER stress may induce apoptosis through caspase-7-mediated caspase-12 activation. The data underscore the involvement of ER and caspases associated with it in the ER stress-induced apoptotic process.},

	Abstract = {The Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 plays a critical role in mammalian innate immune response against viral attacks by recognizing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or its synthetic analog polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (IratioC)). This leads to the activation of MAP kinases and NF-kappaB which results in the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines to combat the viral infection. To understand the complex interplay of the various intracellular signaling molecules in the regulation of NF-kappaB and MAP kinases, we developed a computational TLR3 model based upon perturbation-response approach. We curated literature and databases to determine the TLR3 signaling topology specifically for murine macrophages. For initial model creation, we used wildtype temporal activation profiles of MAP kinases and NF-kappaB and, for model testing, used TRAF6 KO and TRADD KO data. From dynamic simulations we predict i) the existence of missing intermediary steps between extracellular poly (IratioC) stimulation and intracellular TLR3 binding, and ii) the presence of a novel pathway which is essential for JNK and p38, but not NF-kappaB, activation. Our work shows activation dynamics of signaling molecules can be used in conjunction with perturbation-response models to decipher novel signaling features of complicated immune pathways.},

	Abstract = {The ErbB signaling pathways, which regulate diverse physiological responses such as cell survival, proliferation and motility, have been subjected to extensive molecular analysis. Nonetheless, it remains poorly understood how different ligands induce different responses and how this is affected by oncogenic mutations. To quantify signal flow through ErbB-activated pathways we have constructed, trained and analyzed a mass action model of immediate-early signaling involving ErbB1-4 receptors (EGFR, HER2/Neu2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), and the MAPK and PI3K/Akt cascades. We find that parameter sensitivity is strongly dependent on the feature (e.g. ERK or Akt activation) or condition (e.g. EGF or heregulin stimulation) under examination and that this context dependence is informative with respect to mechanisms of signal propagation. Modeling predicts log-linear amplification so that significant ERK and Akt activation is observed at ligand concentrations far below the K(d) for receptor binding. However, MAPK and Akt modules isolated from the ErbB model continue to exhibit switch-like responses. Thus, key system-wide features of ErbB signaling arise from nonlinear interaction among signaling elements, the properties of which appear quite different in context and in isolation.},

	Abstract = {Protein kinases control cellular decision processes by phosphorylating specific substrates. Thousands of in vivo phosphorylation sites have been identified, mostly by proteome-wide mapping. However, systematically matching these sites to specific kinases is presently infeasible, due to limited specificity of consensus motifs, and the influence of contextual factors, such as protein scaffolds, localization, and expression, on cellular substrate specificity. We have developed an approach (NetworKIN) that augments motif-based predictions with the network context of kinases and phosphoproteins. The latter provides 60\%-80\% of the computational capability to assign in vivo substrate specificity. NetworKIN pinpoints kinases responsible for specific phosphorylations and yields a 2.5-fold improvement in the accuracy with which phosphorylation networks can be constructed. Applying this approach to DNA damage signaling, we show that 53BP1 and Rad50 are phosphorylated by CDK1 and ATM, respectively. We describe a scalable strategy to evaluate predictions, which suggests that BCLAF1 is a GSK-3 substrate.},

@article{Gutenkunst:2007oq,
	Abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

Even under such high uncertainty, we show here that ensemble modeling, when combined with targeted experimental analysis, can unravel key operating principles in complex cellular pathways. For proof of concept, we develop a library of mechanistically alternative dynamic models for the highly conserved target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to the prevailing view of a de novo assembly of type 2A phosphatases (PP2As), our integrated computational and experimental analysis proposes a specificity factor, based on Tap42p-Tip41p, for PP2As as the key signaling mechanism that is quantitatively consistent with all available experimental data. Beyond revisiting our picture of TOR signaling, we expect ensemble modeling to help elucidate other insufficiently characterized cellular circuits.},

	Abstract = {Advances in molecular biology provide an opportunity to develop detailed models of biological processes that can be used to obtain an integrated understanding of the system. However, development of useful models from the available knowledge of the system and experimental observations still remains a daunting task. In this work, a model identification strategy for complex biological networks is proposed. The approach includes a state regulator problem (SRP) that provides estimates of all the component concentrations and the reaction rates of the network using the available measurements. The full set of the estimates is utilised for model parameter identification for the network of known topology. An a priori model complexity test that indicates the feasibility of performance of the proposed algorithm is developed. Fisher information matrix (FIM) theory is used to address model identifiability issues. Two signalling pathway case studies, the caspase function in apoptosis and the MAP kinase cascade system, are considered. The MAP kinase cascade, with measurements restricted to protein complex concentrations, fails the a priori test and the SRP estimates are poor as expected. The apoptosis network structure used in this work has moderate complexity and is suitable for application of the proposed tools. Using a measurement set of seven protein concentrations, accurate estimates for all unknowns are obtained. Furthermore, the effects of measurement sampling frequency and quality of information in the measurement set on the performance of the identified model are described.},

	Abstract = {Pancreatic beta-cells are strongly engaged in protein secretion and have highly developed endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Proper folding of polypeptide into a three-dimensional structure is essential for cellular function and protein malfolding can threaten cell survival. Various conditions can perturb the protein folding in the ER, which is collectively called ER stress. In order to adapt ER stress conditions, the cells respond in three distinct ways such as transcriptional induction of ER chaperones, translational attenuation, and ER-associated degradation (ERAD). However, when ER functions are severely impaired, the cell is eliminated by apoptosis via transcriptional induction of CHOP/GADD153, the activation of cJUN NH2-terminal kinase, and/or the activation of caspase-12. Recent studies have revealed that beta-cell is one of the most susceptible cells for ER stress, and ER stress-mediated apoptosis in beta-cells can be a cause of diabetes. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of the ER stress pathway in beta-cells and how it relates to the development of diabetes may contribute to provide new targets for the prevention and treatment of this disease.},

	Abstract = {To study the role of calreticulin in Ca(2+) homeostasis and apoptosis, we generated cells inducible for full-length or truncated calreticulin and measured Ca(2+) signals within the cytosol, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria with "cameleon" indicators. Induction of calreticulin increased the free Ca(2+) concentration within the ER lumen, [Ca(2+)](ER), from 306 +/- 31 to 595 +/- 53 microm, and doubled the rate of ER refilling. [Ca(2+)](ER) remained elevated in the presence of thapsigargin, an inhibitor of SERCA-type Ca(2+) ATPases. Under these conditions, store-operated Ca(2+) influx appeared inhibited but could be reactivated by decreasing [Ca(2+)](ER) with the low affinity Ca(2+) chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. In contrast, [Ca(2+)](ER) decreased much faster during stimulation with carbachol. The larger ER release was associated with a larger cytosolic Ca(2+) response and, surprisingly, with a shorter mitochondrial Ca(2+) response. The reduced mitochondrial signal was not associated with visible morphological alterations of mitochondria or with disruption of the contacts between mitochondria and the ER but correlated with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Altered ER and mitochondrial Ca(2+) responses were also observed in cells expressing an N-truncated calreticulin but not in cells overexpressing calnexin, a P-domain containing chaperone, indicating that the effects were mediated by the unique C-domain of calreticulin. In conclusion, calreticulin overexpression increases Ca(2+) fluxes across the ER but decreases mitochondrial Ca(2+) and membrane potential. The increased Ca(2+) turnover between the two organelles might damage mitochondria, accounting for the increased susceptibility of cells expressing high levels of calreticulin to apoptotic stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death. Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an evolutionarily conserved ER protein that suppresses cell death and that is abundantly expressed in both liver and kidney. We explored the role of BI-1 in protection from ER stress and IR injury by using bi-1 knockout mice, employing models of transient hepatic or renal artery occlusion. Compared to wild-type bi-1 mice, bi-1 knockout mice subjected to hepatic IR injury exhibited these characteristics: (i) increased histological injury; (ii) increased serum transaminases, indicative of more hepatocyte death; (iii) increased percentages of TUNEL-positive hepatocytes; (iv) greater elevations in caspase activity; and (v) more activation of ER stress proteins inositol-requiring enzyme 1 and activating transcription factor 6 and greater increases in expression of ER stress proteins C/EBP homologous protein and spliced XBP-1 protein. Moreover, hepatic IR injury induced elevations in bi-1 mRNA in wild-type liver, suggesting a need for bi-1 gene induction to limit tissue injury. Similar sensitization of kidney to ER stress and IR injury was observed in bi-1(-/-) mice. We conclude that bi-1 provides endogenous protection of liver and kidney from ER stress and IR injury. Analysis of components of the bi-1-dependent pathway for protection from IR injury may therefore reveal new strategies for organ preservation.},

	Abstract = {The 150 kDa oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150) is an inducible endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone with cytoprotective properties in settings of cell stress, such as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Renal tissue from patients with acute renal failure displayed strong induction of ORP150 in tubular epithelium. In a rodent model of renal I/R injury, ORP150 was expressed in both the ischemic and contralateral kidney, principally in the thick ascending loop of Henle (TAL) and distal tubules. Cultured renal epithelial cells exposed to hypoxic or hyperosmotic conditions displayed induction of ORP150. Renal tubular epithelial cells stably transfected with ORP150 sense or antisense cDNA displayed a strong correlation between ORP150 expression and vulnerability to hypoxic/osmotic stress; higher levels of ORP150 were protective, whereas lower levels increased susceptibility to cell death. Compared with nontransgenic controls, transgenic mice overexpressing ORP150 subjected to renal I/R displayed a blunted rise of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and enhanced survival of TAL, consistent with cytoprotection. In contrast, heterozygous ORP150+/- mice, with lower levels of ORP150, showed enhanced renal injury. These data are consistent with the possibility that ORP150 exerts cytoprotective effects in renal tubular epithelia subjected to I/R injury and suggest a key role for ER stress in the renal tubular response to acute renal failure.},

	Abstract = {The enediyne anti-tumour antibiotics are extremely potent cytotoxins, apparently because of their conversion to diradical species which induce DNA double strand breaks with high efficiency. The potency of enediynes suggests their possible utility as effector units for prodrugs which can be activated selectively in tumours, such as bioreductive drugs (BD) or radiation-activated cytotoxins (RAC). However, the similarity of the radical-induced DNA breakage reactions of the enediynes to those caused by ionising radiation suggested that resistance of hypoxic cells might be a potential problem. Experiments with AA8 cells in culture demonstrated that the enediyne antibiotics neocarzinostatin and esperamicin A, (ESP) are much less toxic under hypoxic than aerobic conditions. Sensitivity to ESP (concentration for 90\% cell kill 10 pM) decreased 15-fold under hypoxia, and was partially restored by simultaneous exposure to misonidazole. ESP induced chromosome breakage (micronucleus formation) with an efficiency similar to gamma radiation at equivalent cell kill, suggesting a clastogenic mechanism of cytotoxicity. In contrast, little micronucleus formation was evident after exposure to ESP under hypoxia, even at concentrations giving equivalent cell killing. These findings suggest that resistance of hypoxic cells may limit the utility of enediynes as cytotoxic effectors for BD or RAC prodrug development, and that further investigation of enediynes as anti-tumour agents should include strategies capable of eliminating hypoxic cells.},

@article{belmont2008cga,
	Abstract = {Exposing cells to conditions that modulate growth can impair endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding, leading to ER stress and activation of the transcription factor, ATF6. ATF6 binds to ER stress response elements in target genes, inducing expression of proteins that enhance the ER protein folding capacity, which helps overcome the stress and foster survival. To examine the mechanism of ATF6-mediated survival in vivo, we developed a transgenic mouse model that expresses a novel conditionally activated form of ATF6. We previously showed that activating ATF6 protected the hearts of ATF6 transgenic mice from ER stresses. In the present study, transcript profiling identified modulatory calcineurin interacting protein-1 (MCIP1), also known as regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), as a novel ATF6-inducible gene that encodes a known regulator of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-mediated growth and development in many tissues. The ability of ATF6 to induce RCAN1 in vivo was replicated in cultured cardiac myocytes, where adenoviral (AdV)-mediated overexpression of activated ATF6 induced the RCAN1 promoter, up-regulated RCAN1 mRNA, inhibited calcineurin phosphatase activity, and exerted a striking growth modulating effect that was inhibited by RCAN1-targeted small interfering RNA. These results demonstrate that RCAN1 is a novel ATF6 target gene that may coordinate growth and ER stress signaling pathways. By modulating growth, RCAN1 may reduce the need for ER protein folding, thus helping to overcome the stress and enhance survival. Moreover, these results suggest that RCAN1 may also be a novel integrator of growth and ER stress signaling in many other tissues that depend on calcineurin/NFAT signaling for optimal growth and development.},

Herein, we generated caspase-2-deficient mice to evaluate the requirement for this enzyme in various paradigms of apoptosis. Excess numbers of germ cells were endowed in ovaries of mutant mice and the oocytes were found to be resistant to cell death following exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs. Apoptosis mediated by granzyme B and perforin was defective in caspase-2-deficient B lymphoblasts. In contrast, cell death of motor neurons during development was accelerated in caspase-2-deficient mice. In addition, caspase-2-deficient sympathetic neurons underwent apoptosis more effectively than wild-type neurons when deprived of NGF. Thus, caspase-2 acts both as a positive and negative cell death effector, depending upon cell lineage and stage of development.},

	Abstract = {The protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is regulated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR senses unfolded proteins in the ER lumen and transmits that information to the cell nucleus, where it drives a transcriptional program that is tailored to re-establish homeostasis. Using thin section electron microscopy, we found that yeast cells expand their ER volume at least 5-fold under UPR-inducing conditions. Surprisingly, we discovered that ER proliferation is accompanied by the formation of autophagosome-like structures that are densely and selectively packed with membrane stacks derived from the UPR-expanded ER. In analogy to pexophagy and mitophagy, which are autophagic processes that selectively sequester and degrade peroxisomes and mitochondria, the ER-specific autophagic process described utilizes several autophagy genes: they are induced by the UPR and are essential for the survival of cells subjected to severe ER stress. Intriguingly, cell survival does not require vacuolar proteases, indicating that ER sequestration into autophagosome-like structures, rather than their degradation, is the important step. Selective ER sequestration may help cells to maintain a new steady-state level of ER abundance even in the face of continuously accumulating unfolded proteins.},

	Abstract = {PERK and IRE1 are type-I transmembrane protein kinases that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transmit stress signals in response to perturbation of protein folding. Here we show that the lumenal domains of these two proteins are functionally interchangeable in mediating an ER stress response and that, in unstressed cells, both lumenal domains form a stable complex with the ER chaperone BiP. Perturbation of protein folding promotes reversible dissociation of BiP from the lumenal domains of PERK and IRE1. Loss of BiP correlates with the formation of high-molecular-mass complexes of activated PERK or IRE1, and overexpression of BiP attenuates their activation. These findings are consistent with a model in which BiP represses signalling through PERK and IRE1 and protein misfolding relieves this repression by effecting the release of BiP from the PERK and IRE1 lumenal domains.},

	Abstract = {Tumor cell adaptation to hypoxic stress is an important determinant of malignant progression. While much emphasis has been placed on the role of HIF-1 in this context, the role of additional mechanisms has not been adequately explored. Here we demonstrate that cells cultured under hypoxic/anoxic conditions and transformed cells in hypoxic areas of tumors activate a translational control program known as the integrated stress response (ISR), which adapts cells to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Inactivation of ISR signaling by mutations in the ER kinase PERK and the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha or by a dominant-negative PERK impairs cell survival under extreme hypoxia. Tumors derived from these mutant cell lines are smaller and exhibit higher levels of apoptosis in hypoxic areas compared to tumors with an intact ISR. Moreover, expression of the ISR targets ATF4 and CHOP was noted in hypoxic areas of human tumor biopsy samples. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that activation of the ISR is required for tumor cell adaptation to hypoxia, and suggest that this pathway is an attractive target for antitumor modalities.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The ubiquitously expressed intracellular protein formerly designated p68 has been identified as autoantigen at both the antibody and the T cell level in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We used 2 independent approaches, Edman degradation and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, to characterize p68, and we compared its features with those of the endoplasmic reticulum stress protein BiP. RESULTS: In synovial sections from RA patients, BiP was highly overexpressed as compared with control sections. Under in vitro stress conditions, BiP was found to translocate to the nucleus and the cell surface. BiP-specific autoantibodies were present in 63\% of 400 RA patients, in 7\% of 200 patients with other rheumatic diseases, and in none of the healthy subjects. Thus, BiP-specific autoantibodies represent a new diagnostic marker in RA. Furthermore, we found that BiP-specific T cell reactivity was altered in RA. In healthy individuals and patients with other rheumatic diseases, BiP-reactive T cells were undetectable. In RA, overt T cell reactivity to BiP was observed or could be induced by specifically blocking antigen presentation to potentially regulatory T cells. CONCLUSION: Since overexpression of BiP has been shown to decrease the sensitivity of cells to killing by cytotoxic T cells, BiP overexpression and BiP-specific autoimmunity may be involved in the pathogenesis of RA.},

We also showed that other members of the ER stress proteins family, GRP94 and calreticulin, are also upregulated by VPA. Immunohistochemistry identified that ER stress proteins are increased in frontal and parietal cortex, as well as regions of the hippocampus in rat brain following chronic treatment with VPA. CONCLUSIONS: Regulation of ER stress proteins by VPA may prove to be important to the mechanism of action of the drug. The neuroprotective role of these proteins may also prove to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.},

	Abstract = {The growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein, GADD34, associates with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and promotes in vitro dephosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, (eIF-2 alpha). In this report, we show that the expression of human GADD34 in cultured cells reversed eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation induced by thapsigargin and tunicamycin, agents that promote protein unfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). GADD34 expression also reversed eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation induced by okadaic acid but not that induced by another phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A (CA), which is a result consistent with PP1 being a component of the GADD34-assembled eIF-2 alpha phosphatase. Structure-function studies identified a bipartite C-terminal domain in GADD34 that encompassed a canonical PP1-binding motif, KVRF, and a novel RARA sequence, both of which were required for PP1 binding. N-terminal deletions of GADD34 established that while PP1 binding was necessary, it was not sufficient to promote eIF-2 alpha dephosphorylation in cells. Imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-GADD34 proteins showed that the N-terminal 180 residues directed the localization of GADD34 at the ER and that GADD34 targeted the alpha isoform of PP1 to the ER.

	Abstract = {Protein folding in the cell involves the action of different molecular chaperones and folding-facilitating enzymes. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the folding status of glycoproteins is stringently controlled by a glucosyltranferase enzyme (GT) that creates monoglucosylated structures recognized by ER resident lectins (calnexincalreticulin, CNXCRT). GT serves as a folding sensor because it only glucosylates misfolded or partly folded glycoproteins. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism behind this recognition process remains largely unknown. In this paper we explore the structural determinants for GT recognition by using a single domain model protein. For this purpose we used a family of chemically glycosylated proteins derived from chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 as GT substrates. Structural characterization of species showing higher glucose acceptor capacity suggests that GT recognizes solvent accessible hydrophobic patches in molten globule-like conformers mimicking intermediate folding stages of nascent glycoproteins. It was further confirmed that BiP (binding protein, a chaperone of the heat shock protein 70 family) preferentially recognized neoglycoproteins displaying extended conformations, thus providing a molecular rationale for the sequential BiP-CNXCRT interaction with folding glycoproteins observed in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT), a key player in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control of glycoprotein folding, only glucosylates glycoproteins displaying non-native conformations. To determine whether GT recognizes folding intermediates or irreparably misfolded species with nearly native structures, we generated and tested as GT substrates neoglycoprotein fragments derived from chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (GCI2) bearing from 53 to 64 (full-length) amino acids. Fragment conformations mimicked the last stage-folding structures adopted by a glycoprotein entering the ER lumen. GT catalytic efficiency (V(max)/K(m)) remained constant from GCI2-(1-53) to GCI2-(1-58) and then steadily declined to reach a minimal value with GCI2-(1-64). The same parameter showed a direct hyperbolic relationship with solvent accessibility of the single Trp residue but only in fragments exposing hydrophobic amino acid patches. Mutations introduced (GCI2-(1-63)V63S and GCI2-(1-64)V63S) produced slight structural destabilizations but increased GT catalytic efficiency. This parameter presented an inverse exponential relationship with the free energy of unfolding of canonical and mutant fragments. Moreover, the catalytic efficiency showed a linear relationship with the fraction of unfolded species in water. It was concluded that the GT-derived quality control may be operative with nearly native conformers and that no alternative ER-retaining mechanisms are required when glycoproteins approach their proper folding.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies showed that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells exhibit certain mitochondrial abnormalities including mtDNA mutations, increased superoxide generation, and aberrant mitochondrial biogenesis, which are associated with impaired apoptosis and reduced sensitivity to fludarabine. Here we report that CLL cells and multiple myeloma cells are highly sensitive to brefeldin A, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi protein transport currently being developed as a novel anticancer agent in a prodrug formulation. Of importance, brefeldin A effectively induced apoptosis in fludarabine-refractory CLL cells. Disruption of protein trafficking by brefeldin A caused the sequestration of the prosurvival factors APRIL and VEGF in the ER, leading to abnormal ER swelling and a decrease in VEGF secretion. Such ER stress and blockage of secretory protein traffic eventually resulted in Golgi collapse, activation of caspases, and cell death. Notably, the cellular sensitivity to this compound appeared to be independent of p53 status. Taken together, these findings suggest that malignant B cells may be highly dependent on ER-Golgi protein transport and that targeting this process may be a promising therapeutic strategy for B-cell malignancies, especially for those that respond poorly to conventional treatments.},

	Abstract = {Members of the Bcl-2 protein family that share only the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain are known mostly as sentinels for apoptotic stimuli and initiators of apoptosis. One BH3-only protein, Bim, is the major physiological antagonist of the prosurvival proteins in B and T lymphocytes. It is required for hematopoietic homeostasis and to preclude autoimmunity. Here, we show that the Bim(EL) isoform, which was predominant in T cells, existed in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms. Whereas the unphosphorylated Bim(EL) was sequestered to microtubules by means of a direct interaction with tubulin, the phosphorylated protein was released from microtubules. The freed Bim(EL) was subjected to caspase cleavage at an early stage of apoptosis induced by stimuli that activate either the mitochondria- or death receptor-dependent apoptosis pathway. The N-terminally cleaved Bim(EL) became hyperactive in inducing apoptosis because of its more efficient targeting of Bcl-2. Thus, unlike many other BH3-only proteins, Bim(EL) can be activated downstream of the caspase cascade, leading to a positive feedback amplification of apoptotic signals.},

	Abstract = {ATF6 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane transcription factor that is activated by the ER stress/unfolded protein response by cleavage of its N-terminal half from the membrane. We find that ER stress induces ATF6 to move from the ER to the Golgi, where it is cut in its luminal domain by site 1 protease. ATF6 contains a single transmembrane domain with 272 amino acids oriented in the lumen of the ER. We found that this luminal domain is required for the translocation of ATF6 to the Golgi and its subsequent cleavage, and we have mapped regions required for these properties. These results suggest that the conserved CD1 region is required for translocation, whereas the CD2 region is required for site 1 protease cleavage. We also find that ATF6's luminal domain is sufficient to sense ER stress and cause translocation to the Golgi when fused to LZIP, another ER transmembrane protein. These results show that ATF6 has a mechanism to sense ER stress and respond by translocation to the Golgi.},

The discovery of the ATG genes has provided key information about the formation of the autophagosome, and about the role of macroautophagy in allowing cells to survive during nutrient depletion and/or in the absence of growth factors. Two connected signaling pathways encompassing class-I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and (mammalian) target of rapamycin play a central role in controlling macroautophagy in response to starvation. However, a considerable body of literature reports that macroautophagy is also a cell death mechanism that can occur either in the absence of detectable signs of apoptosis (via autophagic cell death) or concomitantly with apoptosis. Macroautophagy is activated by signaling pathways that also control apoptosis. The aim of this review is to discuss the signaling pathways that control macroautophagy during cell survival and cell death.},

	Abstract = {TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF family with potent apoptosis-inducing properties in tumor cells. In particular, TRAIL strongly synergizes with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs to induce tumor cell death. Thus, TRAIL has been proposed as a promising future cancer therapy. Little, however, is known regarding what the role of TRAIL is in normal untransformed cells and whether therapeutic administration of TRAIL, alone or in combination with other apoptotic triggers, may cause tissue damage. In this study, we investigated the role of TRAIL in Fas-induced (CD95/Apo-1-induced) hepatocyte apoptosis and liver damage. While TRAIL alone failed to induce apoptosis in isolated murine hepatocytes, it strongly amplified Fas-induced cell death. Importantly, endogenous TRAIL was found to critically regulate anti-Fas antibody-induced hepatocyte apoptosis, liver damage, and associated lethality in vivo. TRAIL enhanced anti-Fas-induced hepatocyte apoptosis through the activation of JNK and its downstream substrate, the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homolog Bim. Consistently, TRAIL- and Bim-deficient mice and wild-type mice treated with a JNK inhibitor were protected against anti-Fas-induced liver damage. We conclude that TRAIL and Bim are important response modifiers of hepatocyte apoptosis and identify liver damage and lethality as a possible risk of TRAIL-based tumor therapy.},

Using Western blotting and tandem mass spectroscopy, we have identified the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP, a 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, as a possible autoantigen. It preferentially stimulated increased proliferation of synovial T cells from patients with RA but not from patients with other arthritides. Mice with established collagen- or pristane-induced arthritis developed IgG Abs to BiP. Although BiP injected in CFA failed to induce arthritis in several strains of rats and mice, including HLA-DR4(+/-)- and HLA-DR1(+/+)-transgenic animals, it completely inhibited the development of arthritis when given i.v. 1 wk before the injection of type II collagen arthritis. Preimmunization with BiP suppressed the development of adjuvant arthritis in Lewis rats in a similar manner. This is the first report of a mammalian chaperone that is an autoantigen in human RA and in experimental arthritis and that can also prevent the induction of experimental arthritis. These findings may stimulate the development of new immunotherapies for the treatment of RA.},

	Abstract = {The transcription of genes encoding soluble proteins that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is induced when unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. Thus, an intracellular signal transduction pathway must exist that mediates communication between the ER lumen and the nucleus. We have identified a gene in S. cerevisiae, IRE1, that is required for this pathway: ire1- mutants cannot activate transcription of KAR2 and PDI1, which encode the ER resident proteins BiP and protein disulfide isomerase. Moreover, IRE1 is essential for cell viability under stress conditions that cause unfolded proteins to accumulate in the ER. IRE1 encodes a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase that we propose transmits the unfolded protein signal across the ER or inner nuclear membrane. IRE1 is also required for inositol prototrophy, suggesting that the induction of ER resident proteins is coupled to the biogenesis of new ER membrane.},

	Abstract = {ERp57 is a lumenal protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family. In contrast to archetypal PDI, ERp57 interacts specifically with newly synthesized glycoproteins. In this study we demonstrate that ERp57 forms discrete complexes with the ER lectins, calnexin and calreticulin. Specific ERp57/calreticulin complexes exist in canine pancreatic microsomes, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE after cross-linking, and by native electrophoresis in the absence of cross-linking. After in vitro translation and import into microsomes, radiolabeled ERp57 can be cross-linked to endogenous calreticulin and calnexin while radiolabeled PDI cannot. Likewise, radiolabeled calreticulin is cross-linked to endogenous ERp57 but not PDI. Similar results were obtained in Lec23 cells, which lack the glucosidase I necessary to produce glycoprotein substrates capable of binding to calnexin and calreticulin. This observation indicates that ERp57 interacts with both of the ER lectins in the absence of their glycoprotein substrate. This result was confirmed by a specific interaction between in vitro synthesized calreticulin and ERp57 prepared in solution in the absence of other ER components. We conclude that ERp57 forms complexes with both calnexin and calreticulin and propose that it is these complexes that can specifically modulate glycoprotein folding within the ER lumen.},

	Abstract = {The N-glycan-dependent quality control of glycoprotein folding prevents endoplasmic to Golgi exit of folding intermediates, irreparably misfolded glycoproteins and incompletely assembled multimeric complexes. It also enhances folding efficiency by preventing aggregation and facilitating formation of proper disulfide bonds. The control mechanism essentially involves four components, resident lectin-chaperones that recognize monoglucosylated polymannose glycans, a lectin-associated oxidoreductase acting on monoglucosylated glycoproteins, a glucosyltransferase that creates monoglucosytlated epitopes in protein-linked glycans and a glucosidase that removes the glucose units added by the glucosyltransferase. This last enzyme is the only mechanism component sensing glycoprotein conformations as it creates monoglucosylated glycans exclusively in not properly folded species or in not completely assembled complexes. The glucosidase is a dimeric heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit and an additional one that is partially responsible for the ER localization of the enzyme and for the enhancement of the deglucosylation rate as its mannose 6-phosphate receptor homologous domain presents the substrate to the catalytic site. This review deals with our present knowledge on the glucosyltransferase and the glucosidase.},

	Abstract = {The antiapoptotic role of Bcl-2 can be regulated by its phosphorylation in serine and threonine residues located in a nonstructured loop that links BH3 and BH4 domains. p38 MAPK has been identified as one of the kinases able to mediate such phosphorylation, through direct interaction with Bcl-2 protein in the mitochondrial compartment. In this study, we identify, by using mass spectrometry techniques and specific anti-phosphopeptide antibodies, Ser(87) and Thr(56) as the Bcl-2 residues phosphorylated by p38 MAPK and show that phosphorylation of these residues is always associated with a decrease in the antiapoptotic potential of Bcl-2 protein. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that p38 MAPK-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation plays a key role in the early events following serum deprivation in embryonic fibroblasts. Both cytochrome c release and caspase activation triggered by p38 MAPK activation and Bcl-2 phosphorylation are absent in embryonic fibroblasts from p38alpha knock-out mice (p38alpha(-/-) MEF), whereas they occur within 12 h of serum withdrawal in p38alpha(+/+) MEF; moreover, they can be prevented by p38 MAPK inhibitors and are not associated with the synthesis of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Fas. Thus, Bcl-2 phosphorylation by activated p38 MAPK is a key event in the early induction of apoptosis under conditions of cellular stress.},

	Abstract = {A number of apoptosis-inducing agents used in cancer therapy (etoposide, doxorubicin, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine), as well as the proapoptotic second messenger ceramide, induce a disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi m) that precedes nuclear DNA fragmentation. This effect has been observed in tumor cell lines of T-lymphoid, B-lymphoid, and myelomonocytic origin in vitro. Circulating tumor cells from patients receiving chemotherapy in vivo also demonstrate a delta psi m disruption after in vitro culture that precedes nuclear apoptosis. Transfection-enforced hyperexpression of the proto-oncogenes bcl-2 and bcl-XL protects against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, at both the level of the mitochondrial dysfunction preceding nuclear apoptosis and the level of late nuclear apoptotic events. Bcl-2-mediated inhibition of ceramide-induced delta psi m disruption is observed in normal as well as anucleate cells, indicating that bcl-2 acts on an extranuclear pathway of apoptosis. In contrast to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, hyperexpression of the protease inhibitor cytokine response modifier A fails to protect tumor cells against chemotherapy-induced delta psi m disruption and apoptosis, although cytokine response modifier A does prevent the delta psi m collapse and posterior nuclear apoptosis triggered by cross-linking of Fas/Apo-1/CD95. In conclusion, delta psi m disruption seems to be an obligatory step of early (pre-nuclear) apoptosis, and delta psi m is stabilized by two members of the bcl-2 gene family conferring resistance to chemotherapy.},

The endoplasmic reticulum is the major organelle involved in intracellular calcium homeostasis and calcium signaling, including calcium signals that mediate apoptosis induction by anticancer drugs. But currently a controversy exists regarding reported effects of Bcl-2 on the calcium concentration within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although several prominent reports indicate that Bcl-2 overexpression is associated with a decrease in luminal calcium, there are a large number of reports indicating that Bcl-2 either does not decrease luminal calcium or actually increases luminal calcium. This review summarizes this vast array of conflicting findings, and analyses potential reasons why different conclusions have been reached by different laboratories. Future directions are emphasized that might bring clarity to this important area of apoptosis biology.},

The three beta-sheets and the three hydrophobic clusters form a repeating pattern of interactions across the hairpin that reflects the periodicity of the amino acid sequence, which consists of three 17-residue repeats followed by three 14-residue repeats. Within the global hairpin fold there are two well-ordered subdomains comprising the residues 219-258, and 189-209 and 262-284, respectively. These are separated by a poorly ordered linker region, so that the relative orientation of the two subdomains cannot be precisely described. The structure type observed for CRT(189-288) provides an additional basis for functional studies of the abundant endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calreticulin.},

	Abstract = {Calreticulin (CRT) is an abundant molecular chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum. Its central, proline-rich P-domain, comprising residues 189-288, contains three copies of each of two repeat sequences (types 1 and 2), which are arranged in a characteristic '111222' pattern. Here we show that the three-dimensional structure of CRT(189-288) contains a single hairpin fold formed by the entire polypeptide chain. The loop at the bottom of the hairpin consists of residues 227-247, and is closed by an anti-parallel beta-sheet of residues 224-226 and 248-250. Two additional beta-sheets contain residues 207-209 and 262-264, and 190-192 and 276-278. The 17-residue spacing of the beta-strands in the N-terminal part of the hairpin and the 14-residue spacing in the C-terminal part reflect the length of the type 1 and type 2 sequence repeats. As a consequence of this topology the peptide segments separating the beta-strands in the N-terminal part of the hairpin are likely to form bulges to accommodate the extra residues. These results are based on nearly complete sequence-specific NMR assignments for CRT(189-288), which were obtained using standard NMR techniques with the (13)C/(15)N-labeled protein, and collection of nuclear Overhauser enhancement upper distance constraints.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a cellular compartment responsible for multiple important cellular functions including the biosynthesis and folding of newly synthesized proteins destined for secretion, such as insulin. A myriad of pathological and physiological factors perturb ER function and cause dysregulation of ER homeostasis, leading to ER stress. ER stress elicits a signaling cascade to mitigate stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR). As long as the UPR can relieve stress, cells can produce the proper amount of proteins and maintain ER homeostasis. If the UPR, however, fails to maintain ER homeostasis, cells will undergo apoptosis. Activation of the UPR is critical to the survival of insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells with high secretory protein production. Any disruption of ER homeostasis in beta-cells can lead to cell death and contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes. There are several models of ER-stress-mediated diabetes. In this review, we outline the underlying molecular mechanisms of ER-stress-mediated beta-cell dysfunction and death during the progression of diabetes.},

Although it has been reported that mutations in the WFS1 gene are responsible for the development of this syndrome, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying beta-cell death caused by the WFS1 mutations remain unknown. Here we report that WFS1 is a novel component of the unfolded protein response and has an important function in maintaining homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in pancreatic beta-cells. WFS1 encodes a transmembrane glyco-protein in the ER. WFS1 mRNA and protein are induced by ER stress. The expression of WFS1 is regulated by inositol requiring 1 and PKR-like ER kinase, central regulators of the unfolded protein response. WFS1 is normally up-regulated during insulin secretion, whereas inactivation of WFS1 in beta-cells causes ER stress and beta-cell dysfunction. These results indicate that the pathogenesis of Wolfram syndrome involves chronic ER stress in pancreatic beta-cells caused by the loss of function of WFS1.},

	Abstract = {Plasma cells secrete IgM only in the polymeric form: the C-terminal cysteine of the mu heavy chain (Cys575) is responsible for both intracellular retention and assembly of IgM subunits. Polymerization is not quantitative, and part of IgM is degraded intracellularly. Neither chloroquine nor brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits degradation, suggesting that this process occurs in a pre-Golgi compartment. Degradation of IgM assembly intermediates requires Cys575: the monomeric IgMala575 mutant is stable also when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport is blocked by BFA. Addition of the 20 C-terminal residues of mu to the lysosomal protease cathepsin D is sufficient to induce pre-Golgi retention and degradation of the chimeric protein: the small amounts of molecules which exit from the ER are mostly covalent dimers. By contrast, when retained by the KDEL sequence, cathepsin D is stable in the ER, indicating that retention is not sufficient to cause degradation. Replacing the C-terminal cysteine with serine restores transport through the Golgi. As all chimeric cathepsin D constructs display comparable protease activity in vitro, their different fates are not determined by gross alterations in folding. Thus, also out of its normal context, the mu chain Cys575 plays a crucial role in quality control, mediating assembly, retention and degradation.},

	Abstract = {The lectin chaperone calreticulin (CRT) assists the folding and quality control of newly synthesized glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with ERp57, a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase that promotes the formation of disulfide bonds in glycoproteins bound by CRT. Here, we investigated the interaction between CRT and ERp57 by using biochemical techniques and NMR spectroscopy. We found that ERp57 binds to the P-domain of calreticulin, an independently folding domain comprising residues 189-288. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the dissociation constant of the CRT(189-288)/ERp57 complex is (9.1 +/- 3.0) x 10(-6) M at 8 degrees C. Transverse relaxation-optimized NMR spectroscopy provided data on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the complex formation and on the structure of this 66.5-kDa complex. The NMR measurements yielded a value of (18 +/- 5) x 10(-6) M at 20 degrees C for the dissociation constant and a lower limit for the first-order exchange rate constant of k(off) > 1,000 s(-1) at 20 degrees C. Chemical shift mapping showed that interactions with ERp57 occur exclusively through amino acid residues in the polypeptide segment 225-251 of CRT(189-288), which forms the tip of the hairpin structure of this domain. These results are analyzed with regard to the functional mechanism of the CRT/ERp57 chaperone system.},

	Abstract = {The recent development of hormonal therapy that blocks estrogen synthesis represents a major advance in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, cancer cells often acquire adaptations resulting in resistance. A recent report reveals that estrogen starvation-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells requires BIK, an apoptotic BH3-only protein located primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Searching for novel partners that interact with BIK at the ER, we discovered that BIK selectively forms complex with the glucose-regulated protein GRP78/BiP, a major ER chaperone with prosurvival properties naturally induced in the tumor microenvironment. GRP78 overexpression decreases apoptosis of 293T cells induced by ER-targeted BIK. For estrogen-dependent MCF-7/BUS breast cancer cells, overexpression of GRP78 inhibits estrogen starvation-induced BAX activation, mitochondrial permeability transition, and consequent apoptosis. Further, knockdown of endogenous GRP78 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitizes MCF-7/BUS cells to estrogen starvation-induced apoptosis. This effect was substantially reduced when the expression of BIK was also reduced by siRNA. Our results provide the first evidence that GRP78 confers resistance to estrogen starvation-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells via a novel mechanism mediated by BIK. These results further suggest that GRP78 expression level in the tumor cells may serve as a prognostic marker for responsiveness to hormonal therapy based on estrogen starvation and that combination therapy targeting GRP78 may enhance efficacy and reduce resistance.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human X-box binding protein 1 (hXBP-1) is a transcription factor essential for hepatocyte growth as well as for plasma cell differentiation. hXBP-1 also binds to cis-elements of human T cell leukemia virus and human major histocompatibility complex genes. In order to clarify the role of XBP-1 in breast cancer, here we investigated the expression of XBP-1 in 11 primary breast cancers and 5 breast cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of eleven patients who were underwent surgery for breast cancer from 2000 to 2002. Five breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-453, CRL1500, YMB-1-E, MCF7 and HBL100) were analyzed for XBP-1 expression. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on 6 primary breast cancers. Then we investigated XBP-1 expression by immunohistochemically on archived paraffin-embedded sections. RESULTS: hXBP-1 mRNA expression was increased in all 11 primary breast cancers we examined, as well as 5 breast cancer cell lines, but hardly detectable in non-cancerous breast tissue. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that hXBP-1 protein stained strongly in the cytoplasm of cancer cells but was unreactive in the normal breast ductal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that increased expression of the hXBP-1 gene may play some role in human breast carcinogenesis through impairment of cell differentiation regulation.},

	Abstract = {Dysferlin is a type-II transmembrane protein and the causative gene of limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy (LGMD2B/MM), in which specific loss of dysferlin labeling has been frequently observed. Recently, a novel mutant (L1341P) dysferlin has been shown to aggregate in the muscle of the patient. Little is known about the relationship between degradation of dysferlin and pathogenesis of LGMD2B/MM. Here, we examined the degradation of normal and mutant (L1341P) dysferlin. Wild-type (wt) dysferlin mainly localized to the ER/Golgi, associated with retrotranslocon, Sec61alpha, and VCP(p97), and was degraded by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation system (ERAD) composed of ubiquitin/proteasome. In contrast, mutant dysferlin spontaneously aggregated in the ER and induced eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation and LC3 conversion, a key step for autophagosome formation, and finally, ER stress cell death. Unlike proteasome inhibitor, E64d/pepstatin A, inhibitors of lysosomal proteases did not stimulate the accumulation of the wt-dysferlin, but stimulated aggregation of mutant dysferlin in the ER. Furthermore, deficiency of Atg5 and dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha, key molecules for LC3 conversion, also stimulated the mutant dysferlin aggregation in the ER. Rapamycin, which induces eIF2alpha phosphorylation-mediated LC3 conversion, inhibited mutant dysferlin aggregation in the ER. Thus, mutant dysferlin aggregates in the ER-stimulated autophagosome formation to engulf them via activation of ER stress-eIF2alpha phosphorylation pathway. We propose two ERAD models for dysferlin degradation, ubiquitin/proteasome ERAD(I) and autophagy/lysosome ERAD(II). Mutant dysferlin aggregates on the ER are degraded by the autophagy/lysosome ERAD(II), as an alternative to ERAD(I), when retrotranslocon/ERAD(I) system is impaired by these mutant aggregates.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-3-glycero-phosphorylcholine (oxPAPC) accumulates in atherosclerotic lesions and in vitro studies suggest that it mediates chronic inflammatory response in endothelial cells (ECs). The goal of our studies was to identify pathways mediating the induction of inflammatory genes by oxPAPC. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using expression arrays, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunoblotting we demonstrate that oxPAPC leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in human aortic ECs. Immunohistochemistry analysis of human atherosclerotic lesions indicated that UPR is induced in areas containing oxidized phospholipids. Using the UPR inducing agent tunicamycin and selective siRNA targeting of the ATF4 and XBP1 branches of the UPR, we demonstrate that these transcription factors are essential mediators of IL8, IL6, and MCP1 expression in human aortic ECs required for maximal inflammatory gene expression in the basal state and after oxPAPC treatment. We also identify a novel oxPAPC-induced chemokine, the CXC motif ligand 3 (CXCL3), and show that its expression requires XBP1. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the UPR pathway is a general mediator of vascular inflammation and EC dysfunction in atherosclerosis, and, likely, other inflammatory disorders.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The development of new cancer drugs is slow and costly. HIV protease inhibitors are Food and Drug Administration approved for HIV patients. Because these drugs cause toxicities that can be associated with inhibition of Akt, an emerging target in cancer, we assessed the potential of HIV protease inhibitors as anticancer agents. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HIV protease inhibitors were screened in vitro using assays that measure cellular proliferation, apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy, and activation of Akt. Nelfinavir was tested in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) xenografts with biomarker assessment. RESULTS: Three of six HIV protease inhibitors, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir, inhibited proliferation of NSCLC cells, as well as every cell line in the NCI60 cell line panel. Nelfinavir was most potent with a mean 50\% growth inhibition of 5.2 micromol/L, a concentration achievable in HIV patients. Nelfinavir caused two types of cell death, caspase-dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent death that was characterized by induction of ER stress and autophagy. Autophagy was protective because an inhibitor of autophagy increased nelfinavir-induced death. Akt was variably inhibited by HIV protease inhibitors, but nelfinavir caused the greatest inhibition of endogenous and growth factor-induced Akt activation. Nelfinavir decreased the viability of a panel of drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines and inhibited the growth of NSCLC xenografts that was associated with induction of ER stress, autophagy, and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Nelfinavir is a lead HIV protease inhibitor with pleiotropic effects in cancer cells. Given its wide spectrum of activity, oral availability, and familiarity of administration, nelfinavir is a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that could be repositioned as a cancer therapeutic.},

	Abstract = {Over the last decade, it has become clear that the accumulation of misfolded proteins contributes to a number of neurodegenerative, immune, and endocrine pathologies, as well as other age-related illnesses. Recent interest has focused on the possibility that the accumulation of misfolded proteins can also contribute to vascular and cardiac diseases. In large part, the misfolding of proteins takes place during synthesis on free ribosomes in the cytoplasm or on endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes. In fact, even under optimal conditions, approximately 30\% of all newly synthesized proteins are rapidly degraded, most likely because of improper folding. Accordingly, stresses that perturb the folding of proteins during or soon after synthesis can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and to potential cellular dysfunction and pathological consequences. To avert such outcomes, cells have developed elaborate protein quality-control systems for detecting misfolded proteins and making appropriate adjustments to the machinery responsible for protein synthesis and/or degradation. Important contributors to protein quality control include cytosolic and organelle-targeted molecular chaperones, which help fold and stabilize proteins from unfolding, and the ubiquitin proteasome system, which degrades terminally misfolded proteins. Both of these systems play important roles in cardiovascular biology. The focus of this review is the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, a protein quality-control and signal-transduction system that has not been well studied in the context of cardiovascular biology but that could be important for vascular and cardiac health and disease.},

	Abstract = {The misfolding of nascent proteins, or the unfolding of proteins after synthesis is complete, can occur in response to numerous environmental stresses, or as a result of mutations that de-stabilize protein structure. Cells have developed elaborate protein quality control systems that recognize improperly folded proteins and either refold them or facilitate their degradation. One such quality control system is the unfolded protein response, or the UPR. The UPR is a highly conserved signal transduction system that is activated when cells are subjected to conditions that alter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in ways that impair the folding of nascent proteins in this organelle. Recent observations indicate that in the heart, the UPR is activated during acute stresses, including ischemia/reperfusion, as well as upon longer term stresses that lead to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Moreover, certain aspects of the UPR are activated during, and are required for proper heart development. This review summarizes recent studies of the UPR in the heart, focusing on the possible roles of the UPR in contributing to, or protecting from ischemia/reperfusion damage.},

	Abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and other cytotoxic insults, although the molecule(s) regulated by ROS in TNFalpha signaling have not been identified. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) superfamily that has been shown to be activated during TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. ASK1 increases apoptosis when overexpressed, but the mechanism of ASK1 activation and the mechanisms of ASK1-induced apoptosis are unclear. We now report that hydrogen peroxide induces the activation of ASK1 in 293 cells. TNFalpha-induced activation of ASK1 was inhibited by antioxidants. Hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis was markedly enhanced by the expression of ASK1. These results suggest that TNFalpha-induced activation of ASK1 is mediated by ROS. We also examined how ASK1 activity is regulated by ROS. We found that ASK1 formed dimers or higher order oligomers in 293 cells. TNFalpha or hydrogen peroxide treatment increased the dimeric form of ASK1, and pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine decreased it. Furthermore, synthetic dimerization of an ASK1-gyrase B fusion protein by coumermycin resulted in substantial activation of ASK1, suggesting that dimerization of ASK1 is sufficient for its activation. These results taken together suggest that TNFalpha causes ASK1 activation via ROS-mediated dimerization of ASK1.},

	Abstract = {Excess nitric oxide (NO) induces apoptosis in some cell types, including macrophages. Heat shock protein of 70 kDa (hsp70) has been reported to protect cells from various stresses, including apoptosis-inducing stimuli. Several mammalian cytosolic DnaJ homologs, partner chaperones of hsp70 family members, have been identified. We asked if a DnaJ homolog is required to prevent NO-mediated apoptosis. When mouse macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were treated with an NO donor, SNAP, apoptosis occurred. This apoptosis could be prevented by pretreatment of the cells with heat or a low dose of SNAP. Under these conditions, levels of hsc70 (an hsp70 member) remained unchanged, whereas hsp70 was markedly induced. Of the DnaJ homologs dj1 (hsp40/hdj-1) was strongly induced and dj2 (HSDJ/hdj-2) was moderately induced. In transfection experiments, hsp70, hsc70, dj1 or dj2 alone was ineffective in preventing NO-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, both dj1 and dj2, in combination with hsc70 or hsp70, prevented the cells from apoptosis. The hsp70-DnaJ chaperone pairs exerted their anti-apoptotic effects upstream of caspase 3 activation, and apparently upstream of cytochrome c release from mitochondria.},

Although the role of PTP-1B in dephosphorylating various cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases is clear, the mechanisms by which it modulates receptor function from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains an enigma. Here, we provide evidence that PTP-1B has an essential function in regulating the unfolded protein response in the ER compartment. The absence of PTP-1B caused impaired ER stress-induced IRE1 signaling. More specifically, JNK activation, XBP-1 splicing, and EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein) gene induction, as well as ER stress-induced apoptosis, were attenuated in PTP-1B knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts in response to two ER stressors, tunicamycin and azetidine-2 carboxylic acid. We demonstrate that PTP-1B is not just a passive resident of the ER but on the contrary has an essential role in potentiating IRE1-mediated ER stress signaling pathways.},

	Abstract = {The serine/threonine kinase, PIM1, is involved in promoting cell survival in part by phosphorylation and inhibition of proapoptotic proteins. Apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, is involved in the so-called stress-activated pathways that contribute to apoptotic cell death. Here we show that PIM1 phosphorylates ASK1 specifically on serine residue 83 (Ser83) both in vitro and in vivo and that PIM1 binds to ASK1 in cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Using H1299 cells, our results further demonstrate that PIM1 phosphorylation of ASK1 decreases its kinase activity induced by oxidative stress. PIM1 phosphorylation of ASK1 on Ser83 inhibited ASK1-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation as well as p38 kinase phosphorylation. Under H(2)O(2)-induced stress conditions that normally lead to apoptosis, these phosphorylation events were associated with inhibition of caspase-3 activation and resulted in reduced cell death. Moreover, knockdown of PIM1 in H1299 cells decreased phosphorylation of endogenous Ser83 of ASK1 and was associated with a decrease in cell viability after H(2)O(2) treatment. Taken together, these data reveal a novel mechanism by which PIM1 promotes cell survival that involves negative regulation of the stress-activated kinase, ASK1.},

	Abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a feature of secretory cells and of many diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. Adaptation to ER stress depends on the activation of a signal transduction pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Enhanced expression of Hsp72 has been shown to reduce tissue injury in response to stress stimuli and improve cell survival in experimental models of stroke, sepsis, renal failure, and myocardial ischemia. Hsp72 inhibits several features of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Hsp72 expression inhibits ER stress-induced apoptosis are not clearly understood. Here we show that Hsp72 enhances cell survival under ER stress conditions. The UPR signals through the sensor IRE1alpha, which controls the splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP1. We show that Hsp72 enhances XBP1 mRNA splicing and expression of its target genes, associated with attenuated apoptosis under ER stress conditions. Inhibition of XBP1 mRNA splicing either by dominant negative IRE1alpha or by knocking down XBP1 specifically abrogated the inhibition of ER stress-induced apoptosis by Hsp72. Regulation of the UPR was associated with the formation of a stable protein complex between Hsp72 and the cytosolic domain of IRE1alpha. Finally, Hsp72 enhanced the RNase activity of recombinant IRE1alpha in vitro, suggesting a direct regulation. Our data show that binding of Hsp72 to IRE1alpha enhances IRE1alpha/XBP1 signaling at the ER and inhibits ER stress-induced apoptosis. These results provide a physical connection between cytosolic chaperones and the ER stress response.},

	Abstract = {An activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site (consensus sequence 5'-GTGACGTACAG-3') is a promoter element present in a wide variety of viral and cellular genes. The two best-characterized classes of genes that contain ATF sites are E1A-inducible adenoviral genes and cAMP-inducible cellular genes. Here, we report the isolation of eight ATF cDNA clones, each of which is derived from a separate gene. All ATF cDNA clones examined contain a leucine zipper motif and are significantly similar to one another only within this region. The leucine zipper region of ATF proteins is also similar to that of the AP-1/c-jun family of transcription factors, whose DNA-binding site differs from the ATF-binding site at a single position. DNA binding studies reveal two mechanisms for generating further diversity from the ATF proteins. First, some, but not all, combinations of ATF proteins form heterodimers that efficiently bind to DNA. Second, although all ATF proteins bind to the ATF site, their precise interactions with DNA differ from one another, as evidenced by methylation interference analysis. Our results help to explain how a single promoter element, an ATF site, can be present in a wide variety of promoters.},

	Abstract = {Exposure of cells to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway and transcriptional induction of the inhibitor of apoptosis family of proteins. One of the proximal effectors of the ER stress response, the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), leads to cellular adaptation to stress by multiple mechanisms, including attenuation of protein synthesis and transcriptional induction of pro-survival genes. Although PERK activity leads to cellular adaptation to ER stress, we now demonstrate that PERK activity also inhibits the ER stress-induced apoptotic program through the induction of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP1 and cIAP2) proteins. This induction of IAPs occurs through both transcriptional and translational responses that are PERK dependent. Reintroduction of cIAP1 or cIAP2 expression into PERK-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts during ER stress delays the early onset of ER stress-induced caspase activation and apoptosis observed in these cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway by ER stress is dependent on PERK, suggesting additional ways in which PERK activity protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Using a pulse-chase approach combined with immunoprecipitation, we showed that newly synthesized influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein associate transiently during their folding with calnexin, a membrane-bound endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone. Inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation (tunicamycin) and glucosidases I and II (castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin) prevented the association, whereas inhibitors of ER alpha-mannosidases did not. Our results indicated that binding of these viral glycoproteins to calnexin correlated closely with the composition of their N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Proteins with monoglucosylated oligosaccharides were the most likely binding species. On the basis of our data and existing information concerning the role of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides on glycoproteins, we propose that the ER contains a unique folding and quality control machinery in which calnexin acts as a chaperone that binds proteins with partially glucose-trimmed carbohydrate side chains. In this model glucosidases I and II serve as signal modifiers and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, as a folding sensor.},

Activation of this process leads to reduced rates of initiation of protein translation during ER stress. Here we describe the cloning of perk, a gene encoding a type I transmembrane ER-resident protein. PERK has a lumenal domain that is similar to the ER-stress-sensing lumenal domain of the ER-resident kinase Ire1, and a cytoplasmic portion that contains a protein-kinase domain most similar to that of the known eIF2alpha kinases, PKR and HRI. ER stress increases PERK's protein-kinase activity and PERK phosphorylates eIF2alpha on serine residue 51, inhibiting translation of messenger RNA into protein. These properties implicate PERK in a signalling pathway that attenuates protein translation in response to ER stress.},

Under physiological conditions, PERK was partially activated, accounting for much of the phosphorylated eIF2alpha in the pancreas.

	Abstract = {Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) are molecular chaperones that bind preferentially to monoglucosylated trimming intermediates of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. To determine their role in the maturation of newly synthesized glycoproteins, we analyzed the folding and trimerization of in vitro translated influenza hemagglutinin (HA) in canine pancreas microsomes under conditions in which HA's interactions with CNX and CRT could be manipulated. While CNX bound to all folding intermediates (IT1, IT2 and NT), CRT was found to associate preferentially with the earliest oxidative form (IT1). If HA's binding to CNX and CRT was inhibited using a glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine (CST), the rate of disulfide formation and oligomerization was doubled but the overall efficiency of maturation of HA decreased due to aggregation and degradation. If, on the other hand, HA was arrested in CNX-CRT complexes, folding and trimerization were inhibited. This suggested that the action of CNX and CRT, like that of other chaperones, depended on an 'on-and-off' cycle. Taken together, these results indicated that CNX and CRT promote correct folding by inhibiting aggregation, preventing premature oxidation and oligomerization, and by suppressing degradation of incompletely folded glycopolypeptides.},

Glycans are bulky hydrophilic modifications that serve a variety of structural and functional roles within the cell. Here, we review the recent growing knowledge on the role of Asn-linked glycans as maturation and quality-control protein tags in the early secretory pathway. The carbohydrate composition encodes crucial information about the structure, localization and age of glycoproteins. The "glycan code" is encoded by a series of glycosidases and carbohydrate transferases that line the secretory pathway. This code is deciphered by carbohydrate-binding proteins that possess distinct carbohydrate binding properties and act as molecular chaperones or sorting receptors. These glycosidases and transferases work in concert with resident secretory pathway carbohydrate-binding proteins to form a network that assists in the maturation and trafficking of both native and aberrant glycoproteins within the cell.},

On the other hand, futile folding attempts must actively be stopped to prevent intraluminal accumulation of defective cargo.

	Abstract = {From a process involved in cell wall synthesis in archaea and some bacteria, N-linked glycosylation has evolved into the most common covalent protein modification in eukaryotic cells. The sugars are added to nascent proteins as a core oligosaccharide unit, which is then extensively modified by removal and addition of sugar residues in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex. It has become evident that the modifications that take place in the ER reflect a spectrum of functions related to glycoprotein folding, quality control, sorting, degradation, and secretion. The glycans not only promote folding directly by stabilizing polypeptide structures but also indirectly by serving as recognition "tags" that allow glycoproteins to interact with a variety of lectins, glycosidases, and glycosyltranferases. Some of these (such as glucosidases I and II, calnexin, and calreticulin) have a central role in folding and retention, while others (such as alpha-mannosidases and EDEM) target unsalvageable glycoproteins for ER-associated degradation. Each residue in the core oligosaccharide and each step in the modification program have significance for the fate of newly synthesized glycoproteins.},

	Abstract = {Immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) is a member of the hsp70 family of chaperones and one of the most abundant proteins in the ER lumen. It is known to interact transiently with many nascent proteins as they enter the ER and more stably with protein subunits produced in stoichiometric excess or with mutant proteins. However, there also exists a large number of secretory pathway proteins that do not apparently interact with BiP. To begin to understand what controls the likelihood that a nascent protein entering the ER will associate with BiP, we have examined the in vivo folding of a murine lambdaI immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain (LC). This LC is composed of two Ig domains that can fold independent of the other and that each possess multiple potential BiP-binding sequences. To detect BiP binding to the LC during folding, we used BiP ATPase mutants, which bind irreversibly to proteins, as "kinetic traps." Although both the wild-type and mutant BiP clearly associated with the unoxidized variable region domain, we were unable to detect binding of either BiP protein to the constant region domain. A combination of in vivo and in vitro folding studies revealed that the constant domain folds rapidly and stably even in the absence of an intradomain disulfide bond. Thus, the simple presence of a BiP-binding site on a nascent chain does not ensure that BiP will bind and play a role in its folding. Instead, it appears that the rate and stability of protein folding determines whether or not a particular site is recognized, with BiP preferentially binding to proteins that fold slowly or somewhat unstably.},

It is a major site of protein synthesis, contains the cellular calcium stores that are an essential component of many signaling pathways, and is the proximal site of a signal transduction cascade that responds to cellular stress conditions and serves to maintain homeostasis of the cell. All eucaryotic cells possess an ER, which can comprise nearly 50\% of the membranes of a cell. Its functions can be divided into those that occur on the cytosolic side of the membrane (where protein translation and signal transduction cascades occur) and the luminal space (where most other ER functions take place). Our studies during the past several years have revealed that the ER molecular chaperone BiP is a master regulator of ER function. It is responsible for maintaining the permeability barrier of the ER during protein translocation, directing protein folding and assembly, targeting misfolded proteins for retrograde translocation so they can be degraded by the proteasome, contributing to ER calcium stores, and sensing conditions of stress in this organelle, to activate the mammalian unfolded protein response.},

We investigated UPR signaling events in mice in the absence of the proapoptotic BCL-2 family members BAX and BAK [double knockout (DKO)]. DKO mice responded abnormally to tunicamycin-induced ER stress in the liver, with extensive tissue damage and decreased expression of the IRE1 substrate X-box-binding protein 1 and its target genes. ER-stressed DKO cells showed deficient IRE1alpha signaling. BAX and BAK formed a protein complex with the cytosolic domain of IRE1alpha that was essential for IRE1alpha activation. Thus, BAX and BAK function at the ER membrane to activate IRE1alpha signaling and to provide a physical link between members of the core apoptotic pathway and the UPR.},

	Abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a hallmark feature of secretory cells and many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. Adaptation to protein-folding stress is mediated by the activation of an integrated signal transduction pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR signals through three distinct stress sensors located at the ER membrane-IRE1alpha, ATF6, and PERK. Although PERK and IRE1alpha share functionally similar ER-luminal sensing domains and both are simultaneously activated in cellular paradigms of ER stress in vitro, they are selectively engaged in vivo by the physiological stress of unfolded proteins. The differences in terms of tissue-specific regulation of the UPR may be explained by the formation of distinct regulatory protein complexes. This concept is supported by the recent identification of adaptor and modulator proteins that directly interact with IRE1alpha. In this Review, we discuss recent evidence supporting a model where IRE1alpha signaling emerges as a highly regulated process, controlled by the formation of a dynamic scaffold onto which many regulatory components assemble.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the cytoprotective effects of lithium, the mood-stabilizer, on thapsigargin-induced stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in rat PC12 cells. Protracted lithium pretreatment of PC12 cells elicited cytoprotection against thapsigargin-induced cytotoxicity. Lithium protection was concurrent with inhibition of thapsigargin-induced intracellular calcium increase and with elevated expression of the molecular chaperone GRP78. Moreover, lithium pretreatment upregulated the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, and blocked Bcl-2 downregulation elicited by thapsigargin. Prior to the induction of GRP78, lithium treatment alone increased the expression of c-Fos whose induction by ER stress is necessary for GRP78 induction. Curcumin, an inhibitor of transcription factor AP-1, blocked lithium cytoprotection against thapsigargin cytotoxicity. Thus, the induction of GRP78 and Bcl-2, and activation of AP-1 likely contribute to lithium-induced protection against cytotoxicity resulting from ER stress. Additionally, thapsigargin-induced cytotoxicity was suppressed by pretreatment with another mood-stabilizer, valproate, indicating that cytoprotection against ER stress is a common action of mood-stabilizing drugs.},

@article{hong2004uan,
	Abstract = {ATF6 is a key transcriptional activator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which allows mammalian cells to maintain cellular homeostasis when they are subjected to a variety of environmental and physiological stresses that target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ATF6, a 90-kDa ER transmembrane protein, contains three evolutionarily conserved N-linked glycosylation sites within its carboxyl luminal domain. Although it is well established that p90ATF6 activation requires transit from the ER to the Golgi, where it is cleaved by the S1P/S2P protease system to generate a nuclear form p60ATF6 that acts as a transcriptional activator, the functional significance of p90ATF6 N-linked glycosylation is unknown. Here we show that ER Ca(2+) depletion stress, a triggering mechanism for the UPR, induces the formation of ATF6(f), which represents de novo partial glycosylation of newly synthesized p90ATF6. By mutating a single amino acid within the N-linked glycosylation site closest to the carboxyl terminus of p90ATF6, we recreated ATF6(f). This mutation sharply reduces p90ATF6 association with calreticulin, a major Ca(2+)-binding chaperone for N-glycoprotein. We further determined that ATF6(f) exhibits a faster rate of constitutive transport to the Golgi, resulting in a higher level of p60ATF6 in the nucleus and stronger transactivating activity in the absence of ER stress. Additional analysis of p90ATF6 mutants targeting single or multiple N-glycosylation sites also showed higher constitutive transactivating activity than wild type ATF6. Because accumulation of underglycosylated proteins in the ER is a potent inducer for the UPR, these studies uncover a novel mechanism whereby the glycosylation status of p90ATF6 can serve as a sensor for ER homeostasis, resulting in ATF6 activation to trigger the UPR.},

	Abstract = {The quality control mechanism in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) discriminates correctly folded proteins from misfolded polypeptides and determines their fate. Terminally misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated from the ER and degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes, a mechanism known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). We report the cDNA cloning of Edem, a mouse gene encoding a putative type II ER transmembrane protein. Expression of Edem mRNA was induced by various types of ER stress. Although the luminal region of ER degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) is similar to class I alpha1,2-mannosidases involved in N-glycan processing, EDEM did not have enzymatic activity. Overexpression of EDEM in human embryonic kidney 293 cells accelerated the degradation of misfolded alpha1-antitrypsin, and EDEM bound to this misfolded glycoprotein. The results suggest that EDEM is directly involved in ERAD, and targets misfolded glycoproteins for degradation in an N-glycan dependent manner.},

	Abstract = {Macroautophagy is an evolutionary conserved lysosomal pathway involved in the turnover of cellular macromolecules and organelles. In spite of its essential role in tissue homeostasis, the molecular mechanisms regulating mammalian macroautophagy are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a rise in the free cytosolic calcium ([Ca(2+)](c)) is a potent inducer of macroautophagy. Various Ca(2+) mobilizing agents (vitamin D(3) compounds, ionomycin, ATP, and thapsigargin) inhibit the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin, a negative regulator of macroautophagy, and induce massive accumulation of autophagosomes in a Beclin 1- and Atg7-dependent manner. This process is mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-beta and AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibited by ectopic Bcl-2 located in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), where it lowers the [Ca(2+)](ER) and attenuates agonist-induced Ca(2+) fluxes. Thus, an increase in the [Ca(2+)](c) serves as a potent inducer of macroautophagy and as a target for the antiautophagy action of ER-located Bcl-2.},

	Abstract = {The unfolded protein response, which is activated in response to the loss of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) homeostasis and/or the accumulation of misfolded, unassembled, or aggregated proteins in the ER lumen, involves both transcriptional and translational regulation. In the current studies we sought to identify novel ER stress-induced genes by conducting microarray analysis on tunicamycin-treated cells. We identified P58(IPK), an inhibitor of the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, as induced during ER stress. Additional studies suggested that p58(IPK) induction was mediated via ATF6 and that P58(IPK) played a role in down-regulating the activity of the pancreatic eIF2 kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha)-like ER kinase/activation transcription factor (ATF) 4 pathway. Modulation of P58(IPK) levels altered the phosphorylation status of eIF2alpha, and thereby affected expression of its downstream targets, ATF4 and Gadd153. Overexpression of P58(IPK) inhibited eIF2alpha phosphorylation and reduced ATF4 and Gadd153 protein accumulation, whereas silencing of P58(IPK) expression enhanced pancreatic eIF2alpha-like ER kinase and eIF2alpha phosphorylation and increased ATF4 and Gadd153 accumulation. These findings implicate P58(IPK) as an important component of a negative feedback loop used by the cell to inhibit eIF2alpha signaling, and thus attenuate the unfolded protein response.},

Parkin protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like domain at its NH(2)-terminus and two RING finger motifs and an IBR (in between RING fingers) at its COOH terminus (RING-IBR-RING). Here, we show that Parkin is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which binds to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, including UbcH7 and UbcH8, through its RING-IBR-RING motif. Moreover, we found that unfolded protein stress induces up-regulation of both the mRNA and protein level of Parkin. Furthermore, overexpression of Parkin, but not a set of mutants without the E3 activity, specifically suppressed unfolded protein stress-induced cell death. These findings demonstrate that Parkin is an E3 enzyme and suggest that it is involved in the ubiquitination pathway for misfolded proteins derived from endoplasmic reticulum and contributes to protection from neurotoxicity induced by unfolded protein stresses.},

	Abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests a pathophysiologic role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in kidney disease. This study investigated the potential of therapeutic approaches targeting ER stress in the anti-Thy1 model of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis in rats. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting showed a time-dependent increase in the expression of the ER stress-inducible chaperones glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and oxygen-related protein 150 in isolated glomeruli, especially in the glomerular epithelial cells and mesangial cells, after induction of anti-Thy1 nephritis. For evaluation of whether preconditioning with ER stress ameliorates the severity of disease, rats were pretreated with a subnephritogenic dose of the ER stress inducer tunicamycin or thapsigargin for 4 d before disease was induced. Although preconditioning with ER stress had no effect on the degree of disease induction, it strongly ameliorated the manifestations of disease, evidenced by marked reductions in microaneurysm formation, mesangial proliferation, and adhesion of Bowman's capsule to the glomerular tuft. This improvement in histologic damage was associated with reduced proteinuria (39.4 +/- 10.5 versus 126.1 +/- 18.1 mg/d; P < 0.01) and with attenuated increases in glucose-regulated protein 78 and oxygen-related protein 150 expression. Of note, pretreatment with tunicamycin or thapsigargin decreased the excessive ER stress-induced intracellular signaling observed in anti-Thy1 nephritis. In conclusion, preconditioning with ER stress ameliorates the severity of disease in rats with anti-Thy1 nephritis. These findings suggest the possibility of therapeutic approaches targeting ER stress in mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.},

	Abstract = {Wolfram syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, is caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene. In order to gain insight into the pathophysiology of this disease, we disrupted the wfs1 gene in mice. The mutant mice developed glucose intolerance or overt diabetes due to insufficient insulin secretion in vivo. Islets isolated from mutant mice exhibited a decrease in insulin secretion in response to glucose. The defective insulin secretion was accompanied by reduced cellular calcium responses to the secretagogue. Immunohistochemical analyses with morphometry and measurement of whole-pancreas insulin content demonstrated progressive beta-cell loss in mutant mice, while the alpha-cell, which barely expresses WFS1 protein, was preserved. Furthermore, isolated islets from mutant mice exhibited increased apoptosis, as assessed by DNA fragment formation, at high concentration of glucose or with exposure to endoplasmic reticulum-stress inducers. These results strongly suggest that WFS1 protein plays an important role in both stimulus-secretion coupling for insulin exocytosis and maintenance of beta-cell mass, deterioration of which leads to impaired glucose homeostasis. These WFS1 mutant mice provide a valuable tool for understanding better the pathophysiology of Wolfram syndrome as well as WFS1 function.},

	Abstract = {Stress protein GRP78/BiP is highly induced in progressively growing tumors and has recently been shown to exert a protective role against lysis by cytotoxic T cells and tumor necrosis factor in vitro. This raises the question whether the in vitro observed protective function of GRP78/BiP translates into the in vivo situation in which tumors grow progressively, killing the host. Herein we report that molecular inhibition of GRP78/BiP induction in the fibrosarcoma B/C10ME, while not affecting in vitro cell proliferation, causes a dramatic increase in apoptotic cell death upon Ca2+ depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum. When B/C10ME cells incapable of inducing GRP78/BiP are injected into mice, tumors are initially formed that, however, regress presumably due to a cytotoxic T-cell response demonstrable by a strong in vitro response to the tumor with spleen cells of regressor mice. Since sensitivity to apoptosis is key to tumor rejection, these results may point to new approaches to the therapy of cancer via regulation of stress protein GRP78/BiP.},

	Abstract = {The pathophysiology of bipolar disorder is still unclear, although family, twin and linkage studies implicate genetic factors. Here we identified XBP1, a pivotal gene in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, as contributing to the genetic risk factor for bipolar disorder. Using DNA microarray analysis of lymphoblastoid cells derived from two pairs of twins discordant with respect to the illness, we found downregulated expression of genes related to ER stress response in both affected twins. A polymorphism (-116C-->G) in the promoter region of XBP1, affecting the putative binding site of XBP1, was significantly more common in Japanese patients (odds ratio = 4.6) and overtransmitted to affected offspring in trio samples of the NIMH Bipolar Disorder Genetics Initiative. XBP1-dependent transcription activity of the -116G allele was lower than that of the -116C allele, and in the cells with the G allele, induction of XBP1 expression after ER stress was markedly reduced. Valproate, one of three mood stabilizers, rescued the impaired response by inducing ATF6, the gene upstream of XBP1. These results indicate that the -116C-->G polymorphism in XBP1 causes an impairment of its positive feedback system and increases the risk of bipolar disorder.},

Previously, we preliminarily reported the genetic association of HSPA5 (GRP78/BiP) with bipolar disorder. Here, we extended our analysis by increasing the number of Japanese case-control samples and NIMH Genetics Initiative bipolar trio samples (NIMH trios), and also analyzed schizophrenia samples. In Japanese, nominally significant association of one haplotype was observed in extended samples of bipolar disorder but not in schizophrenia. In NIMH trios, no association was found in total samples. However, an exploratory analysis suggested that the other haplotype was significantly over-transmitted to probands only from the paternal side. The associated haplotype in Japanese or NIMH pedigrees shared three common polymorphisms in the promotor, which was found to alter promotor activity. These findings suggested promotor polymorphisms of HSPA5 may affect the interindividual variability of ER stress response and may confer a genetic risk factor for bipolar disorder.},

	Abstract = {Mutant alpha(1)-antitrypsin Z (alpha(1)-ATZ) protein, which has a tendency to form aggregated polymers as it accumulates within the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver cells, is associated with the development of chronic liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma in hereditary alpha(1)-antitrypsin (alpha(1)-AT) deficiency. Previous studies have suggested that efficient intracellular degradation of alpha(1)-ATZ is correlated with protection from liver disease in alpha(1)-AT deficiency and that the ubiquitin-proteasome system accounts for a major route, but not the sole route, of alpha(1)-ATZ disposal. Yet another intracellular degradation system, autophagy, has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of alpha(1)-AT deficiency. To provide genetic evidence for autophagy-mediated disposal of alpha(1)-ATZ, here we used cell lines deleted for the Atg5 gene that is necessary for initiation of autophagy. In the absence of autophagy, the degradation of alpha(1)-ATZ was retarded, and the characteristic cellular inclusions of alpha(1)-ATZ accumulated. In wild-type cells, colocalization of the autophagosomal membrane marker GFP-LC3 and alpha(1)-ATZ was observed, and this colocalization was enhanced when clearance of autophagosomes was prevented by inhibiting fusion between autophagosome and lysosome. By using a transgenic mouse with liver-specific inducible expression of alpha(1)-ATZ mated to the GFP-LC3 mouse, we also found that expression of alpha(1)-ATZ in the liver in vivo is sufficient to induce autophagy. These data provide definitive evidence that autophagy can participate in the quality control/degradative pathway for alpha(1)-ATZ and suggest that autophagic degradation plays a fundamental role in preventing toxic accumulation of alpha(1)-ATZ.},

	Abstract = {Missense mutations in the human presenilin-1 (PS1) gene, which is found on chromosome 14, cause early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). FAD-linked PS1 variants alter proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein and cause an increase in vulnerability to apoptosis induced by various cell stresses. However, the mechanisms responsible for these phenomena are not clear. Here we report that mutations in PS1 affect the unfolded-protein response (UPR), which responds to the increased amount of unfolded proteins that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) under conditions that cause ER stress. PS1 mutations also lead to decreased expression of GRP78/Bip, a molecular chaperone, present in the ER, that can enable protein folding. Interestingly, GRP78 levels are reduced in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. The downregulation of UPR signalling by PS1 mutations is caused by disturbed function of IRE1, which is the proximal sensor of conditions in the ER lumen. Overexpression of GRP78 in neuroblastoma cells bearing PS1 mutants almost completely restores resistance to ER stress to the level of cells expressing wild-type PS1. These results show that mutations in PS1 may increase vulnerability to ER stress by altering the UPR signalling pathway.},

	Abstract = {Eukaryotic cells have developed specific mechanisms to overcome environmental stress. Here we show that the Src homology 2/3 (SH2/SH3) domain-containing protein Nck-1 prevents the unfolded protein response normally induced by pharmacological endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress agents. Overexpression of Nck-1 enhances protein translation, whereas it abrogates eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation and inhibition of translation in response to tunicamycin or thapsigargin treatment. Nck-1 overexpression also attenuates induction of the ER chaperone, the immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP), and impairs cell survival in response to thapsigargin. We provided evidence that in these conditions, the effects of Nck on the unfolded protein response (UPR) involve its second SH3 domain and a calyculin A-sensitive phosphatase activity. In addition, we demonstrated that protein translation is reduced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both Nck isoforms and is enhanced in similar cells expressing high levels of Nck-1. In these various mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we also provided evidence that Nck modulates the activation of the ER resident eIF2alpha kinase PERK and consequently the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha on Ser-51 in response to stress. Our study establishes that Nck is required for optimal protein translation and demonstrates that, in addition to its adaptor function in mediating signaling from the plasma membrane, Nck also mediates signaling from the ER membrane compartment.},

The gene spans approx. 17 kb of DNA and has been shown to encode mRNA of approx. 2.7 kb that is present in cell lines representing lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, indicating that it is ubiquitously expressed. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 2.7 kb mRNA has been derived from cDNA and genomic clones. The longest open reading frame obtained for G13 codes for a 703 amino acid protein of approx. 77 kDa in molecular mass. Comparison of the putative G13 amino acid sequence with the protein databases revealed significant similarities with DNA-binding proteins of the leucine zipper class, including a human cAMP response element binding protein. G13 contains a bZIP motif, a region rich in basic amino acids adjacent to a coiled-coil leucine zipper domain, common to this class of proteins that is known to be involved in dimerization and DNA binding. Antibodies raised against a fragment encoding the C-terminal half of the putative G13 protein recognized a major polypeptide of approx. 86 kDa and a minor polypeptide of approx. 78 kDa on immunoblotting of U937 cell extracts; this has been confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments. Even though it contained at least one potential bipartite nuclear localization signal, the G13 protein was present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the fibroblast cells. Thus G13 might be a novel DNA-binding protein that is perhaps translocated to the nucleus in a regulated manner.},

Here we describe a novel functional interaction between Akt and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase. Akt decreased ASK1 kinase activity stimulated by both oxidative stress and overexpression in 293 cells by phosphorylating a consensus Akt site at serine 83 of ASK1. Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway also inhibited the serum deprivation-induced activity of endogenous ASK1 in L929 cells. An association between Akt and ASK1 was detected in cells by coimmunoprecipitation. Phosphorylation by Akt inhibited ASK1-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase and activating transcription factor 2 activities in intact cells. Finally, activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway reduced apoptosis induced by ASK1 in a manner dependent on phosphorylation of serine 83 of ASK1. These results provide the first direct link between Akt and the family of stress-activated kinases.},

	Abstract = {Chaperone protein BiP binds to Ire1 and dissociates in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, it remains unclear how the signal transducer Ire1 senses ER stress and is subsequently activated. The crystal structure of the core stress-sensing region (CSSR) of yeast Ire1 luminal domain led to the controversial suggestion that the molecule can bind to unfolded proteins. We demonstrate that, upon ER stress, Ire1 clusters and actually interacts with unfolded proteins. Ire1 mutations that affect these phenomena reveal that Ire1 is activated via two steps, both of which are ER stress regulated, albeit in different ways. In the first step, BiP dissociation from Ire1 leads to its cluster formation. In the second step, direct interaction of unfolded proteins with the CSSR orients the cytosolic effector domains of clustered Ire1 molecules.},

	Abstract = {In the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway, accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates a transmembrane kinase/ribonuclease Ire1, which causes the transcriptional induction of ER-resident chaperones, including BiP/Kar2. It was previously hypothesized that BiP/Kar2 plays a direct role in the signaling mechanism. In this model, association of BiP/Kar2 with Ire1 represses the UPR pathway while under conditions of ER stress, BiP/Kar2 dissociation leads to activation. To test this model, we analyzed five temperature-sensitive alleles of the yeast KAR2 gene. When cells carrying a mutation in the Kar2 substrate-binding domain were incubated at the restrictive temperature, association of Kar2 to Ire1 was disrupted, and the UPR pathway was activated even in the absence of extrinsic ER stress. Conversely, cells carrying a mutation in the Kar2 ATPase domain, in which Kar2 poorly dissociated from Ire1 even in the presence of tunicamycin, a potent inducer of ER stress, were unable to activate the pathway. Our findings provide strong evidence in support of BiP/Kar2-dependent Ire1 regulation model and suggest that Ire1 associates with Kar2 as a chaperone substrate. We speculate that recognition of unfolded proteins is based on their competition with Ire1 for binding with BiP/Kar2.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells contains an abundant 78,000-Da protein (BiP) that is involved in the translocation, folding, and assembly of secretory and transmembrane proteins. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as in mammalian cells, BiP mRNA is synthesized at a high basal rate and is further induced by the presence of increased amounts of unfolded proteins in the ER. However, unlike mammalian BiP, yeast BiP is also induced severalfold by heat shock, albeit in a transient fashion. To identify the regulatory sequences that respond to these stimuli in the yeast KAR2 gene that encodes BiP, we have cloned a 1.3-kb segment of DNA from the region upstream of the sequences coding for BiP and fused it to a reporter gene, the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene. Analysis of a series of progressive 5' truncations as well as internal deletions of the upstream sequence showed that the information required for accurate transcriptional regulation of the KAR2 gene in S. cerevisiae is contained within a approximately 230-bp XhoI-DraI fragment (nucleotides -245 to -9) and that this fragment contains at least two cis-acting elements, one (heat shock element [HSE]) responding to heat shock and the other (unfolded protein response element [UPR]) responding to the presence of unfolded proteins in the ER. The HSE and UPR elements are functionally independent of each other but work additively for maximum induction of the yeast KAR2 gene. Lying between these two elements is a GC-rich region that is similar in sequence to the consensus element for binding of the mammalian transcription factor Sp1 and that is involved in the basal expression of the KAR2 gene. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that yeast cells monitor the concentration of free BiP in the ER and adjust the level of transcription of the KAR2 gene accordingly; this effect is mediated via the UPR element in the KAR2 promoter.},

	Abstract = {Herp is a 54-kDa membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mRNA expression level of Herp is increased by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Transcriptional changes designed to deal with this type of ER stress is called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Most mammalian UPR-target genes encode ER-resident molecular chaperones: GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin. The promoter regions of these genes contain a cis-acting ER stress response element, ERSE, with the consensus sequence of CCAAT-N(9)-CCACG. Under conditions of ER stress, p50ATF6 (the active form of the transcription factor, ATF6) binds to CCACG when CCAAT is bound by the general transcription factor, NF-Y/CBF. Here, we report the genomic structure of human Herp and the presence of a new ER stress response element, ERSE-II, in its promoter region. The gene for Herp consists of eight exons, localized to chromosome 16q12.2-13. The promoter region contains a single ERSE-like sequence. In reporter gene assays, disruption of this cis-element resulted in a partial reduction of the transcriptional response to ER stress, suggesting that the element is functional for the UPR. These results also suggest the involvement of additional elements in the UPR. Further analysis, using an optimized plasmid containing an mRNA-destabilizing sequence, revealed ERSE-II (ATTGG-N-CCACG) as the second ER stress response element. Interestingly, ERSE-II was also dependent on p50ATF6, in a manner similar to that of ERSE, despite the disparate structure. The strong induction of Herp mRNA by ER stress would be achieved by the cooperation of ERSE and ERSE-II.},

	Abstract = {Hypoxia has recently been shown to activate the endoplasmic reticulum kinase PERK, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and inhibition of mRNA translation initiation. Using a quantitative assay, we show that this inhibition exhibits a biphasic response mediated through two distinct pathways. The first occurs rapidly, reaching a maximum at 1-2 h and is due to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Continued hypoxic exposure activates a second, eIF2alpha-independent pathway that maintains repression of translation. This phase is characterized by disruption of eIF4F and sequestration of eIF4E by its inhibitor 4E-BP1 and transporter 4E-T. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of polysomal RNA indicates that the translation efficiency of individual genes varies widely during hypoxia. Furthermore, the translation efficiency of individual genes is dynamic, changing dramatically during hypoxic exposure due to the initial phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Together, our data indicate that acute and prolonged hypoxia regulates mRNA translation through distinct mechanisms, each with important contributions to hypoxic gene expression.},

	Abstract = {Hypoxia profoundly influences tumor development and response to therapy. While progress has been made in identifying individual gene products whose synthesis is altered under hypoxia, little is known about the mechanism by which hypoxia induces a global downregulation of protein synthesis. A critical step in the regulation of protein synthesis in response to stress is the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha on Ser51, which leads to inhibition of new protein synthesis. Here we report that exposure of human diploid fibroblasts and transformed cells to hypoxia led to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, a modification that was readily reversed upon reoxygenation. Expression of a transdominant, nonphosphorylatable mutant allele of eIF2alpha attenuated the repression of protein synthesis under hypoxia. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident eIF2alpha kinase PERK was hyperphosphorylated upon hypoxic stress, and overexpression of wild-type PERK increased the levels of hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Cells stably expressing a dominant-negative PERK allele and mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a homozygous deletion of PERK exhibited attenuated phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and reduced inhibition of protein synthesis in response to hypoxia. PERK(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts failed to phosphorylate eIF2alpha and exhibited lower survival after prolonged exposure to hypoxia than did wild-type fibroblasts. These results indicate that adaptation of cells to hypoxic stress requires activation of PERK and phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and suggest that the mechanism of hypoxia-induced translational attenuation may be linked to ER stress and the unfolded-protein response.},

	Abstract = {Expanded polyglutamine 72 repeat (polyQ72) aggregates induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated cell death with caspase-12 activation and vesicular formation (autophagy). We examined this relationship and the molecular mechanism of autophagy formation. Rapamycin, a stimulator of autophagy, inhibited the polyQ72-induced cell death with caspase-12 activation. PolyQ72, but not polyQ11, stimulated Atg5-Atg12-Atg16 complex-dependent microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP1) light chain 3 (LC3) conversion from LC3-I to -II, which plays a key role in autophagy. The eucaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) A/A mutation, a knock-in to replace a phosphorylatable Ser51 with Ala51, and dominant-negative PERK inhibited polyQ72-induced LC3 conversion. PolyQ72 as well as ER stress stimulators upregulated Atg12 mRNA and proteins via eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Furthermore, Atg5 deficiency as well as the eIF2alpha A/A mutation increased the number of cells showing polyQ72 aggregates and polyQ72-induced caspase-12 activation. Thus, autophagy formation is a cellular defense mechanism against polyQ72-induced ER-stress-mediated cell death by degrading polyQ72 aggregates, with PERK/eIF2alpha phosphorylation being involved in polyQ72-induced LC3 conversion.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is a defense system for dealing with the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Recent reports have shown that ER stress is involved in the pathology of some neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral ischemia. In a screen for compounds that induce the ER-mediated chaperone BiP (immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein)/GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein), we identified BiP inducer X (BIX). BIX preferentially induced BiP with slight inductions of GRP94 (94 kDa glucose-regulated protein), calreticulin, and C/EBP homologous protein. The induction of BiP mRNA by BIX was mediated by activation of ER stress response elements upstream of the BiP gene, through the ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) pathway. Pretreatment of neuroblastoma cells with BIX reduced cell death induced by ER stress. Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with BIX reduced the area of infarction due to focal cerebral ischemia in mice. In the penumbra of BIX-treated mice, ER stress-induced apoptosis was suppressed, leading to a reduction in the number of apoptotic cells. Considering these results together, it appears that BIX induces BiP to prevent neuronal death by ER stress, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic agent for cerebral diseases caused by ER stress.},

	Abstract = {Reperfusion after global brain ischemia results initially in a widespread suppression of protein synthesis in neurons, which persists in vulnerable neurons, that is caused by the inhibition of translation initiation as a result of the phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). To identify kinases responsible for eIF2alpha phosphorylation [eIF2alpha(P)] during brain reperfusion, we induced ischemia by bilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by post-ischemic assessment of brain eIF2alpha(P) in mice with homozygous functional knockouts in the genes encoding the heme-regulated eIF2alpha kinase (HRI), or the amino acid-regulated eIF2alpha kinase (GCN2). A 10-fold increase in eIF2alpha(P) was observed in reperfused wild-type mice and in the HRI-/- or GCN2-/- mice. However, in all reperfused groups, the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum eIF2alpha kinase (PERK) exhibited an isoform mobility shift on SDS-PAGE, consistent with the activation of the kinase. These data indicate that neither HRI nor GCN2 are required for the large increase in post-ischemic brain eIF2alpha(P), and in conjunction with our previous report that eIF2alpha(P) is produced in the brain of reperfused PKR-/- mice, provides evidence that PERK is the kinase responsible for eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the early post-ischemic brain.},

	Abstract = {Eukaryotic cells control the levels of molecular chaperones and folding enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a transcriptional induction process termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). The mammalian UPR is mediated by the cis-acting ER stress response element consisting of 19 nt (CCAATN(9)CCACG), the CCACG part of which is considered to provide specificity. We recently identified the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein ATF6 as a mammalian UPR-specific transcription factor; ATF6 is activated by ER stress-induced proteolysis and binds directly to CCACG. Here we report that eukaryotic cells express another bZIP protein closely related to ATF6 in both structure and function. This protein encoded by the G13 (cAMP response element binding protein-related protein) gene is constitutively synthesized as a type II transmembrane glycoprotein anchored in the ER membrane and processed into a soluble form upon ER stress as occurs with ATF6. The proteolytic processing of ATF6 and the G13 gene product is accompanied by their relocation from the ER to the nucleus; their basic regions seem to function as a nuclear localization signal. Overexpression of the soluble form of the G13 product constitutively activates the UPR, whereas overexpression of a mutant lacking the activation domain exhibits a strong dominant-negative effect. Furthermore, the soluble forms of ATF6 and the G13 gene product are unable to bind to several point mutants of the cis-acting ER stress response element in vitro that hardly respond to ER stress in vivo. We thus concluded that the two related bZIP proteins are crucial transcriptional regulators of the mammalian UPR, and propose calling the ATF6 gene product ATF6alpha and the G13 gene product ATF6beta.},

	Abstract = {A number of eukaryotic viruses have evolved mechanisms to downregulate activity of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (referred to as P68 based on its Mr of 68,000 in human cells). This control is essential because once activated, the P68 kinase phosphorylates its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), limiting functional eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 available for protein synthesis initiation. We have previously shown that influenza virus encoded a specific mechanism to repress the autophosphorylation and activity of P68. Using in vitro assays for P68 inhibition, we now have purified, to near homogeneity, the P68 repressor from influenza virus-infected cells. The purified product inhibited both the autophosphorylation of P68 as well as phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 by the kinase. We tested for both protease and phosphatase activity but found neither activity associated with the purified inhibitor. Surprisingly we found the purified repressor, which had an apparent Mr of approximately 58,000, was a cellular and not a viral-encoded protein. Possible mechanisms by which influenza virus activates this cellular regulator of the protein kinase, thereby minimizing potential antiviral effects of interferon, are discussed.},

	Abstract = {All eukaryotic cells respond to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by signaling an adaptive pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). In yeast, a type-I ER transmembrane protein kinase, Ire1p, is the proximal sensor of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen that initiates an unconventional splicing reaction on HAC1 mRNA. Hac1p is a transcription factor required for induction of UPR genes. In higher eukaryotic cells, the UPR also induces site-2 protease (S2P)-mediated cleavage of ER-localized ATF6 to generate an N-terminal fragment that activates transcription of UPR genes. To elucidate the requirements for IRE1alpha and ATF6 for signaling the mammalian UPR, we identified a UPR reporter gene that was defective for induction in IRE1alpha-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and S2P-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We show that the endoribonuclease activity of IRE1alpha is required to splice XBP1 (X-box binding protein) mRNA to generate a new C terminus, thereby converting it into a potent UPR transcriptional activator. IRE1alpha was not required for ATF6 cleavage, nuclear translocation, or transcriptional activation. However, ATF6 cleavage was required for IRE1alpha-dependent induction of UPR transcription. We propose that nuclear-localized IRE1alpha and cytoplasmic-localized ATF6 signaling pathways merge through regulation of XBP1 activity to induce downstream gene expression. Whereas ATF6 increases the amount of XBP1 mRNA, IRE1alpha removes an unconventional 26-nucleotide intron that increases XBP1 transactivation potential. Both processing of ATF6 and IRE1alpha-mediated splicing of XBP1 mRNA are required for full activation of the UPR.},

	Abstract = {Novel agents that target the proteasome, a proteolytic complex responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy in multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy. However, the mechanism by which these compounds act remains unknown. A signaling pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR) allows cells to handle the proper folding of proteins. The transcription factor XBP-1, a regulator of the UPR, is also required for plasma cell differentiation, suggesting a link between the UPR and plasma cell differentiation. Here we show that proteasome inhibitors target XBP-1 and the UPR in myeloma cells. Proteasome inhibitors suppress the activity of the translumenal endoplasmic reticulum endoribonuclease/kinase, IRE1 alpha, to impair the generation of the active, spliced XBP-1 species and simultaneously stabilize the unspliced species that acts as a dominant negative. Myeloma cells rendered functionally deficient in XBP-1 undergo increased apoptosis in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Identification of compounds that target the activity of IRE1 alpha/XBP-1 may yield novel therapies for the treatment of multiple myeloma and other malignancies that rely on an intact UPR.},

We found that the transcription factor XBP1, a key regulator of the unfolded protein response, is required for the unrelated function of normal fatty acid synthesis in the liver. XBP1 protein expression in mice was elevated after feeding carbohydrates and corresponded with the induction of critical genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Inducible, selective deletion of XBP1 in the liver resulted in marked hypocholesterolemia and hypotriglyceridemia, secondary to a decreased production of lipids from the liver.

Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an evolutionarily conserved ER-resident protein that suppresses cell death. Here we have investigated the role of BI-1 in the UPR. BI-1 expression suppressed IRE1alpha activity in fly and mouse models of ER stress. BI-1-deficient cells displayed hyperactivation of the ER stress sensor IRE1alpha, leading to increased levels of its downstream target X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1) and upregulation of UPR target genes. This phenotype was associated with the formation of a stable protein complex between BI-1 and IRE1alpha, decreasing its ribonuclease activity. Finally, BI-1 deficiency increased the secretory activity of primary B cells, a phenomenon regulated by XBP-1. Our results suggest a role for BI-1 in early adaptive responses against ER stress that contrasts with its known downstream function in apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {The role of conformation-based quality control in the early secretory pathway is to eliminate misfolded polypeptides and unassembled multimeric protein complexes from the endoplasmic reticulum, ensuring the deployment of only functional molecules to distal sites. The intracellular fate of terminally misfolded human alpha1-antitrypsin was examined in hepatoma cells to identify the functional role of asparagine-linked oligosaccharide modification in the selection of glycoproteins for degradation by the cytosolic proteasome. Proteasomal degradation required physical interaction with the molecular chaperone calnexin. Altered sedimentation of intracellular complexes following treatment with the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, and in combination with mannosidase inhibition, revealed that the removal of mannose from attached oligosaccharides abrogates the release of misfolded alpha1-antitrypsin from calnexin prior to proteasomal degradation. Intracellular turnover was arrested with kifunensine, implicating the participation of endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I in the disposal process. Accelerated degradation occurred in a mannosidase-independent manner and was arrested by lactacystin, in response to the posttranslational inhibition of glucosidase II, demonstrating that the attenuated removal of glucose from attached oligosaccharides functions as the underlying rate-limiting step in the proteasome-mediated pathway. A model is proposed in which the removal of mannose from multiple attached oligosaccharides directs calnexin in the selection of misfolded alpha1-antitrypsin for degradation by the proteasome.},

	Abstract = {In response to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cells activate an intracellular signal transduction pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR). IRE and PERK are the two type-I ER transmembrane protein kinase receptors that signal the UPR. The N-terminal luminal domains (NLDs) of IRE1 and PERK sense ER stress conditions by a common mechanism and transmit the signal to regulate the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors. To provide an experimental system amenable to detailed biochemical and structural analysis to elucidate the mechanism of ER-transmembrane signaling mechanism mediated by the NLD, we overexpressed the soluble luminal domain of human IRE1alpha in COS-1 cells by transient DNA transfection. Here we report the expression, purification, and characterization of the soluble NLD. The biological function of the NLD was confirmed by its ability to associate with itself and to interact with both the membrane-bound full-length IRE1alpha receptor and the ER chaperone BiP. Functional and spectral studies suggested that the highly conserved N-linked glycosylation site is not required for proper protein folding and self-association. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the NLD forms stable dimers linked by intermolecular disulfide bridges. Our data support that the luminal domain represents a novel ligand-independent dimerization domain.},

	Abstract = {Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum activates a signal transduction cascade that culminates in the transcriptional induction of genes encoding adaptive functions. One proximal sensor for this unfolded protein response is the protein kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1alpha. IRE1alpha is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein for which the N-terminal luminal domain (NLD) senses the accumulation of unfolded proteins. Previously we demonstrated that the NLD forms a stable ligand-independent dimer linked by disulfide bridges. In this report we have identified the cysteine residues responsible for intermolecular disulfide bonding. However, this covalent interaction was not required for dimerization and/or signaling, suggesting that a cryptic dimer interface exists in the NLD that is independent of covalent disulfide interactions. Limited proteolysis of the NLD revealed characteristic fragments, all retaining the same N-terminal sequences as full-length NLD. Biochemical and functional studies using NLD truncation mutants indicated that the dimerization domain of the NLD is confined to the conserved motifs at the N-terminal regions where putative hydrophobic interactions exist. In addition, the peptide binding domain of the endoplasmic reticulum protein chaperone BiP interacted with the N-terminal region within the NLD. Our findings suggest that the NLD has at least two distinct types of interactions mediating dimerization and function in signaling, i.e. covalent interactions involving disulfide bond formation and hydrophobic interactions, with the hydrophobic interaction being the driving force for dimerization.},

	Abstract = {Stress-induced eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) alpha phosphorylation paradoxically increases translation of the metazoan activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), activating the integrated stress response (ISR), a pro-survival gene expression program. Previous studies implicated the 5' end of the ATF4 mRNA, with its two conserved upstream ORFs (uORFs), in this translational regulation. Here, we report on mutation analysis of the ATF4 mRNA which revealed that scanning ribosomes initiate translation efficiently at both uORFs and ribosomes that had translated uORF1 efficiently reinitiate translation at downstream AUGs. In unstressed cells, low levels of eIF2alpha phosphorylation favor early capacitation of such reinitiating ribosomes directing them to the inhibitory uORF2, which precludes subsequent translation of ATF4 and represses the ISR. In stressed cells high levels of eIF2alpha phosphorylation delays ribosome capacitation and favors reinitiation at ATF4 over the inhibitory uORF2. These features are common to regulated translation of GCN4 in yeast. The metazoan ISR thus resembles the yeast general control response both in its target genes and its mechanistic details.},

	Abstract = {We have previously shown that ASK1-interacting protein 1 (AIP1) transduces tumor necrosis factor-induced ASK1-JNK signaling. Because endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates ASK1-JNK signaling cascade, we investigated the role of AIP1 in ER stress-induced signaling. We created AIP1-deficient mice (AIP1-KO) from which mouse embryonic fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells were isolated. AIP1-KO cells show dramatic reductions in ER stress-induced, but not oxidative stress-induced, ASK1-JNK activation and cell apoptosis. The ER stress-induced IRE1-JNK/XBP-1 axis, but not the PERK-CHOP1 axis, is blunted in AIP1-KO cells. ER stress induced formation of an AIP1-IRE1 complex, and the PH domain of AIP1 is critical for the IRE1 interaction. Furthermore, reconstitution of AIP1-KO cells with AIP1 wild type, not an AIP1 mutant with a deletion of the PH domain (AIP1-DeltaPH), restores ER stress-induced IRE1-JNK/XBP-1 signaling. AIP1-IRE1 association facilitates IRE1 dimerization, a critical step for activation of IRE1 signaling. More importantly, AIP1-KO mice show impaired ER stress-induced IRE1-dependent signaling in vivo. We conclude that AIP1 is essential for transducing the IRE1-mediated ER stress response.},

	Abstract = {Transient protein synthesis inhibition is an important protective mechanism used by cells during various stress conditions including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This response centers on the phosphorylation state of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2 alpha, which is induced by kinases like protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) and GCN2 to suppress translation and is later reversed so translation resumes. GADD34 was recently identified as the factor that activates the type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1), which dephosphorylates eIF-2 alpha during cellular stresses. Our study delineates a negative feedback regulatory loop in which the eIF-2 alpha-controlled inhibition of protein translation leads to GADD34 induction, which promotes translational recovery. We show that activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4), which is paradoxically translated during the eIF-2 alpha-mediated translational block, is required for the transactivation of the GADD34 promoter in response to ER stress and amino acid deprivation. ATF4 directly binds to and trans-activates a conserved ATF site in the GADD34 promoter during ER stress. Examination of ATF4-/- MEFs revealed an absence of GADD34 induction, prolonged eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation, delayed protein synthesis recovery, and diminished translational up-regulation of BiP during ER stress. These studies demonstrate the essential role of GADD34 in the resumption of protein synthesis, define the pathway for its induction, and reveal that cytoprotective unfolded protein response targets like BiP are sensitive to the eIF-2 alpha-mediated block in translation.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site where proteins enter the secretory pathway. Proteins are translocated into the ER lumen in an unfolded state and require protein chaperones and catalysts of protein folding to attain their final appropriate conformation. A sensitive surveillance mechanism exists to prevent misfolded proteins from transiting the secretory pathway and ensures that persistently misfolded proteins are directed towards a degradative pathway. In addition, those processes that prevent accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen are highly regulated by an intracellular signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR provides a mechanism by which cells can rapidly adapt to alterations in client protein-folding load in the ER lumen by expanding the capacity for protein folding. In addition, a variety of insults that disrupt protein folding in the ER lumen also activate the UPR. These include changes in intralumenal calcium, altered glycosylation, nutrient deprivation, pathogen infection, expression of folding-defective proteins, and changes in redox status. Persistent protein misfolding initiates apoptotic cascades that are now known to play fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of multiple human diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases.},

	Abstract = {The molecular chaperone HSP90 regulates stability and function of multiple protein kinases. The HSP90-binding drug geldanamycin interferes with this activity and promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of most HSP90 client proteins. Geldanamycin also binds to GRP94, the HSP90 paralog located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Because two of three ER stress sensors are transmembrane kinases, namely IRE1alpha and PERK, we investigated whether HSP90 is necessary for the stability and function of these proteins. We found that HSP90 associates with the cytoplasmic domains of both kinases. Both geldanamycin and the HSP90-specific inhibitor, 514, led to the dissociation of HSP90 from the kinases and a concomitant turnover of newly synthesized and existing pools of these proteins, demonstrating that the continued association of HSP90 with the kinases was required to maintain their stability. Further, the previously reported ability of geldanamycin to stimulate ER stress-dependent transcription apparently depends on its interaction with GRP94, not HSP90, since geldanamycin but not 514 led to up-regulation of BiP. However, this effect is eventually superseded by HSP90-dependent destabilization of unfolded protein response signaling. These data establish a role for HSP90 in the cellular transcriptional response to ER stress and demonstrate that chaperone systems on both sides of the ER membrane serve to integrate this signal transduction cascade.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum represents the quality control site of the cell for folding and assembly of cargo proteins. A variety of conditions can alter the ability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to properly fold proteins, thus resulting in ER stress. Cells respond to ER stress by activating different signal transduction pathways leading to increased transcription of chaperone genes, decreased protein synthesis, and eventually to apoptosis. In the present paper we analyzed the role that the adaptor protein tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) plays in regulating cellular responses to apoptotic stimuli from the endoplasmic reticulum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from TRAF2-/- mice were more susceptible to apoptosis induced by ER stress than the wild type counterpart. This increased susceptibility to ER stress-induced apoptosis was because of an increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species following ER stress, and was abolished by the use of antioxidant. In addition, we demonstrated that the NF-kappaB pathway protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis, controlling ROS accumulation. Our results underscore the involvement of TRAF2 in regulating ER stress responses and the role of NF-kappaB in protecting cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {CHOP/gadd153 is a transcription factor induced by cellular stresses such as UV light, genotoxic agents, and protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum. The fact that these stresses induce CHOP expression, and at the same time cause cellular apoptosis, suggests that CHOP may be directly involved in apoptosis. However, evidence has been circumstantial. Here, we show that CHOP can directly induce apoptosis. A GFP-tagged CHOP vector, ectopically overexpressed in several cell types (3T3 fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and HeLa cells), caused apoptosis as defined by morphology, DNA fragmentation, and FACS analysis. Apoptosis was quantified using a rapid fluorescence assay that measures the signal from cells collected in culture supernatants. The apoptosis-modulating effects of p38 kinase, previously shown to phosphorylate CHOP, were also examined. Simultaneous overexpression of CHOP and p38 significantly augmented apoptosis. However, although p38 kinase clearly modulated the activity of full-length CHOP, it was not absolutely required. Deletion mapping experiments showed that the bZIP region of CHOP stimulates apoptosis to nearly the same extent as wild-type CHOP. Thus, while the amino-terminal region of CHOP serves an important modulatory role (i.e., regulation by p38), the underlying apoptosis-inducing activity of CHOP resides within the bZIP region of the molecule.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the mechanisms of ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), this process was reconstituted in vitro. Established procedures for post-translational translocation of radiolabeled prepro-alpha factor into isolated yeast microsomes were modified to inhibit glycosylation and to include a posttranslocation "chase" incubation period to monitor degradation. Glycosylation was inhibited with a glyco-acceptor peptide to compete for core carbohydrates, or by using a radio-labeled alpha factor precursor that had been genetically engineered to eliminate all three glycosylation sites. Inhibition of glycosylation led to the production of unglycosylated pro-alpha factor (p alpha F), a processed form of the alpha factor precursor shown to be a substrate of ERAD in vivo. With this system, both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of pro-alpha factor were stable throughout a 90-min chase incubation. However, the addition of cytosol to the chase incubation reaction induced a selective and rapid degradation of p alpha F. These results directly reflect the behavior of alpha factor precursor in vivo; i.e., p alpha F is a substrate for ERAD, while glycosylated pro-alpha factor is not. Heat inactivation and trypsin treatment of cytosol, as well as addition of ATP gamma S to the chase incubations, led to a stabilization of p alpha F. ERAD was observed in sec12 microsomes, indicating that export of p alpha F via transport vesicles was not required. Furthermore, p alpha F but not glycosylated pro-alpha factor was found in the supernatant of the chase incubation reactions, suggesting a specific transport system for this ERAD substrate. Finally, the degradation of p alpha F was inhibited when microsomes from a yeast strain containing a disrupted calnexin gene were examined. Together, these results indicate that cytosolic protein factor(s), ATP hydrolysis, and calnexin are required for ER-associated protein degradation in yeast, and suggest the cytosol as the site for degradation.},

	Abstract = {gadd153, also known as chop, is a highly stress-inducible gene that is robustly expressed following disruption of homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (so-called ER stress). Although all reported types of ER stress induce expression of Gadd153, its role in the stress response has remained largely undefined. Several studies have correlated Gadd153 expression with cell death, but a mechanistic link between Gadd153 and apoptosis has never been demonstrated. To address this issue we employed a cell model system in which Gadd153 is constitutively overexpressed, as well as two cell lines in which Gadd153 expression is conditional. In all cell lines, overexpression of Gadd153 sensitized cells to ER stress. Investigation of the mechanisms contributing to this effect revealed that elevated Gadd153 expression results in the down-regulation of Bcl2 expression, depletion of cellular glutathione, and exaggerated production of reactive oxygen species. Restoration of Bcl2 expression in Gadd153-overexpressing cells led to replenishment of glutathione and a reduction in levels of reactive oxygen species, and it protected cells from ER stress-induced cell death. We conclude that Gadd153 sensitizes cells to ER stress through mechanisms that involve down-regulation of Bcl2 and enhanced oxidant injury.},

While there is extensive biochemical characterization of the multiple steps in cap-dependent initiation, most of the information on the other two mechanisms is derived from studies on the nucleic acid sequences that influence their efficiency. However, even in the best of circumstances, both re-initiation and internal initiation are only 25% as efficient as cap-dependent initiation and more commonly, are only 1-10% as efficient. This general lack of efficiency leaves open possibilities for mis-interpretation/artifacts in vivo (cryptic promoters, alternate splicing) or in vitro (nuclease degradation). Two examples are cited from the author's laboratory as background for the development of a general set of guidelines to minimize errors and validate authenticity for internal initiation.},

	Abstract = {Mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS1) gene cause early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) by a mechanism believed to involve perturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function and altered proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying cell death and ER dysfunction in cultured cells and knock-in mice expressing FAD PS1 mutations. We report that PS1 mutations cause a marked increase in basal protein levels of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor Gadd153. PS1 mutations increase Gadd153 protein translation without affecting mRNA levels, while decreasing levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Moreover, an exaggerated Gadd153 response to stress induced by ER stress agents was observed in PS1 mutant cells. Cell death in response to ER stress is enhanced by PS1 mutations, and this endangering effect is attenuated by anti-sense-mediated suppression of Gadd153 production. An abnormality in the translational regulation of Gadd153 may sensitize cells to the detrimental effects of ER stress and contribute to the pathogenic actions of PS1 mutations in FAD.},

An initially selected short cDNA was used to isolate a 2639-nucleotide, apparently full-length cDNA from a human tonsil library. This cDNA contained one extended open reading frame that predicted a protein of 700 amino acids with a basic region and a leucine zipper that is highly similar to members of the Creb/ATF subfamily. High-stringency Southern blotting of total human genomic DNA using this cDNA as the probe showed only a single locus that mapped to the selecting YAC clone. This gene, designated Creb-related protein (Creb-rp), is expressed ubiquitously and is evolutionarily conserved in mammals. It is located in the HLA Class III region 6-10 kb centromeric of the XB gene, which encodes a tenascin-like extracellular matrix protein. Homologous sequences are located in the Class II-Class III interval of the mouse H-2 complex. The amino acid sequence homology and general structural features of the predicted protein indicate that this gene encodes a general transcription factor belonging to the Creb/ATF subfamily of the bZip super-family.},

	Abstract = {The assembly of the CD-95 (Fas/Apo-1) receptor death-inducing signaling complex occurs in a hierarchical manner; the death domain of CD-95 binds to the corresponding domain in the adapter molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD) Mort-1, which in turn recruits the zymogen form of the death protease caspase-8 (FLICE/Mach-1) by a homophilic interaction involving the death effector domains. Immediately after recruitment, the single polypeptide FLICE zymogen is proteolytically processed to the active dimeric species composed of large and small catalytic subunits. Since all caspases cleave their substrates after Asp residues and are themselves processed from the single-chain zymogen to the two-chain active enzyme by cleavage at internal Asp residues, it follows that an upstream caspase can process a downstream zymogen. However, since FLICE represents the most apical caspase in the Fas pathway, its mode of activation has been enigmatic. We hypothesized that the FLICE zymogen possesses intrinsic enzymatic activity such that when approximated, it autoprocesses to the active protease. Support for this was provided by (i) the synthesis of chimeric Fpk3FLICE molecules that can be oligomerized in vivo by the synthetic cell-permeable dimerizer FK1012H2. Cells transfected with Fpk3FLICE underwent apoptosis after exposure to FK1012H2; (ii) the creation of a nonprocessable zymogen form of FLICE that retained low but detectable protease activity.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional organelle which co-ordinates protein folding, lipid biosynthesis, calcium storage and release. Perturbations that disrupt ER homeostasis lead to the misfolding of proteins, ER stress and up-regulation of a signaling pathway called the ER stress response or the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is characterized by the induction of chaperones, degradation of misfolded proteins and attenuation of protein translation. Age-related declines and activity in key molecular chaperones and folding enzymes compromise proper protein folding and the adaptive response of the UPR. This review will highlight age-related changes in the protein folding machinery and in the UPR.},

@article{nakagawa2000caspase,
	Abstract = {Apoptosis, or cellular suicide, is important for normal development and tissue homeostasis, but too much or too little apoptosis can also cause disease. The family of cysteine proteases, the so- called caspases, are critical mediators of programmed cell death, and thus far 14 family members have been identified. Some of these, such as caspase-8, mediate signal transduction downstream of death receptors located on the plasma membrane. Others, such as caspase-9, mediate apoptotic signals after mitochondrial damage. Stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can also result in apoptosis. Here we show that caspase-12 is localized to the ER and activated by ER stress, including disruption of ER calcium homeostasis and accumulation of excess proteins in ER, but not by membrane- or mitochondrial-targeted apoptotic signals. Mice that are deficient in caspase-12 are resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis, but their cells undergo apoptosis in response to other death stimuli. Furthermore, we show that caspase-12-deficient cortical neurons are defective in apoptosis induced by amyloid-beta protein but not by staurosporine or trophic factor deprivation. Thus, caspase-12 mediates an ER-specific apoptosis pathway and may contribute to amyloid-beta neurotoxicity.},

	Abstract = {Bortezomib (Velcade, formerly known as PS-341) is a boronic acid dipeptide derivative that is a selective and potent inhibitor of the proteasome. We hypothesized that proteasome inhibition would lead to an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cell resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The ability of bortezomib to induce ER stress and the unfolded protein response was investigated in a human pancreatic cancer cell line, L3.6pl. Bortezomib increased expression of ER stress markers, CHOP and BiP, but inhibited PKR-like ER kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eif2alpha), both of which are key events in translational suppression. These effects resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins leading to protein aggregation and proteotoxicity. Peptide inhibitor or small interfering RNA targeting ER-resident caspase-4 blocked DNA fragmentation, establishing a central role for caspase-4 in bortezomib-induced cell death. The translation inhibitor cycloheximide abrogated bortezomib-induced protein aggregation, caspase-4 processing, and all other characteristics of apoptosis. Because malignant cells have higher protein synthesis rates than normal cells, they may be more prone to protein aggregation and proteotoxicity and possess increased sensitivity to bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Taken together, the results show that bortezomib induces a unique type of ER stress compared with other ER stress agents characterized by an absence of eif2alpha phosphorylation, ubiquitylated protein accumulation, and proteotoxicity.},

	Abstract = {Autoantibody-mediated diseases like myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and systemic lupus erythematosus represent a therapeutic challenge. In particular, long-lived plasma cells producing autoantibodies resist current therapeutic and experimental approaches. Recently, we showed that the sensitivity of myeloma cells toward proteasome inhibitors directly correlates with their immunoglobulin synthesis rates. Therefore, we hypothesized that normal plasma cells are also hypersensitive to proteasome inhibition owing to their extremely high amount of protein biosynthesis. Here we show that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, eliminates both short- and long-lived plasma cells by activation of the terminal unfolded protein response. Treatment with bortezomib depleted plasma cells producing antibodies to double-stranded DNA, eliminated autoantibody production, ameliorated glomerulonephritis and prolonged survival of two mouse strains with lupus-like disease, NZB/W F1 and MRL/lpr mice. Hence, the elimination of autoreactive plasma cells by proteasome inhibitors might represent a new treatment strategy for antibody-mediated diseases.},

	Abstract = {In response to stress, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signaling machinery triggers the inhibition of protein synthesis and up-regulation of genes whose products are involved in protein folding, cell cycle exit, and/or apoptosis. We demonstrate that the misfolding agents azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Azc) and tunicamycin initiate signaling from the ER, resulting in the activation of Jun-N-terminal kinase, p44(MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK-1), and p38(MAPK) through IRE1alpha-dependent mechanisms. To characterize the ER proximal signaling events involved, immuno-isolated ER membranes from rat fibroblasts treated with ER stress inducers were used to reconstitute the activation of the stress-activated protein kinase/mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in vitro. This allowed us to demonstrate a role for the SH2/SH3 domain containing adaptor Nck in ERK-1 activation after Azc treatment. We also show both in vitro and in vivo that under basal conditions ER-associated Nck represses ERK-1 activation and that upon ER stress this pool of Nck dissociates from the ER membrane to allow ERK-1 activation. Moreover, under the same conditions, Nck-null cells elicit a stronger ERK-1 activation in response to Azc stress, thus, correlating with an enhanced survival phenotype. These data delineate a novel mechanism for the regulation of ER stress signaling to the MAPK pathway and demonstrate a critical role for Nck in ER stress and cell survival.},

	Abstract = {The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to allow cells to adapt to stress targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Induction of ER chaperone GRP78/BiP increases protein folding capacity; as such it represents a major survival arm of UPR. Considering the central importance of the UPR in regulating cell survival and death, evidence is emerging that cells evolve feedback regulatory pathways to modulate the key UPR executors, however, the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the fortuitous discovery of GRP78va, a novel isoform of GRP78 generated by alternative splicing (retention of intron 1) and alternative translation initiation. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses revealed that expression of GRP78va is enhanced by ER stress and is notably elevated in human leukemic cells and leukemia patients. In contrast to the canonical GRP78 which is primarily an ER lumenal protein, GRP78va is devoid of the ER signaling peptide and is cytosolic. Through specific knockdown of endogenous GRP78va by siRNA without affecting canonical GRP78, we showed that GRP78va promotes cell survival under ER stress. We further demonstrated that GRP78va has the ability to regulate PERK signaling and that GRP78va is able to interact with and antagonize PERK inhibitor P58(IPK). Our study describes the discovery of GRP78va, a novel cytosolic isoform of GRP78/BiP, and the first characterization of the modulation of UPR signaling via alternative splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA. Our study further reveals a novel survival mechanism in leukemic cells and other cell types where GRP78va is expressed.},

Various physiological stimuli increase [Ca2+]i transiently and, thereby, induce cellular responses. However, under pathological conditions, changes of [Ca2+]i are generally more pronounced and sustained. Marked elevations of [Ca2+]i activate hydrolytic enzymes, lead to exaggerated energy expenditure, impair energy production, initiate cytoskeletal degradation, and ultimately result in cell death.

SOD1(mut)-induced ER stress activated the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-dependent cell death pathway. Perturbation of binding between SOD1(mut) and Derlin-1 by Derlin-1-derived oligopeptide suppressed SOD1(mut)-induced ER stress, ASK1 activation, and motor neuron death.

We show that yeast HAC1 mRNA is correctly spliced in mammalian cells upon UPR induction and that mammalian Ire1 can precisely cleave both splice junctions. Surprisingly, UPR induction leads to proteolytic cleavage of Ire1, releasing fragments containing the kinase and nuclease domains that accumulate in the nucleus. Nuclear localization and UPR induction are reduced in presenilin-1 knockout cells.

	Abstract = {Autophagy is a bulk protein degradation process that is induced by starvation. The control mechanism for induction of autophagy is not well understood. We found that Tor, a phosphatidylinositol kinase homologue, is involved in the control of autophagy in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When rapamycin, an inhibitor of Tor function, is added, autophagy is induced even in cells growing in nutrient-rich medium. A temperature-sensitive tor mutant also leads to induction of autophagy at a nonpermissive temperature. These results indicate that Tor negatively regulates the induction of autophagy. Tor is the first molecule that is identified as a pivotal player in the starvation-signaling pathway of autophagy. Furthermore, we found that a high concentration of cAMP is inhibitory for induction of autophagy. APG gene products are involved in autophagy induced by starvation. Autophagy was not induced in apg mutants in the presence of rapamycin, indicating that the site of action of Tor is upstream of those of Apg proteins. In nutrient-rich medium, Apg proteins are involved also in the transport of aminopeptidase I from the cytosol to the vacuole. Tor may act to switch Apg function between autophagy and transport of aminopeptidase I.},

Fragoli, and N.J. Holbrook. 1989. Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:4196-4203; Lord K.A., B. Hoffman-Lieberman, and D.A. Lieberman. 1990. Nucleic Acid Res. 18:2823), was isolated and found to attenuate CHOP (also known as GADD153) activation by both protein malfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum, and amino acid deprivation. Despite normal activity of the cognate stress-inducible eIF2alpha kinases PERK (also known as PEK) and GCN2, phospho-eIF2alpha levels were markedly diminished in GADD34-overexpressing cells. GADD34 formed a complex with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) that specifically promoted the dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha in vitro. Mutations that interfered with the interaction with PP1c prevented the dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha and blocked attenuation of CHOP by GADD34. Expression of GADD34 is stress dependent, and was absent in PERK(-)/- and GCN2(-)/- cells. These findings implicate GADD34-mediated dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha in a negative feedback loop that inhibits stress-induced gene expression, and that might promote recovery from translational inhibition in the unfolded protein response.},

	Abstract = {Eukaryotic cells deal with accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the unfolded protein response, involving the induction of molecular chaperones, translational attenuation, and ER-associated degradation, to prevent cell death. Here, we found that the autophagy system is activated as a novel signaling pathway in response to ER stress. Treatment of SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells with ER stressors markedly induced the formation of autophagosomes, which were recognized at the ultrastructural level. The formation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3-labeled structures (GFP-LC3 "dots"), representing autophagosomes, was extensively induced in cells exposed to ER stress with conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II. In IRE1-deficient cells or cells treated with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, the autophagy induced by ER stress was inhibited, indicating that the IRE1-JNK pathway is required for autophagy activation after ER stress. In contrast, PERK-deficient cells and ATF6 knockdown cells showed that autophagy was induced after ER stress in a manner similar to the wild-type cells. Disturbance of autophagy rendered cells vulnerable to ER stress, suggesting that autophagy plays important roles in cell survival after ER stress.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is recognized as an organelle that participates in folding secretory and membrane proteins. The ER responds to stress by upregulating ER chaperones, but prolonged and/or excess ER stress leads to apoptosis. However, the potential role of ER stress in pathophysiological hearts remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham operation. Echocardiographic analysis demonstrated that mice 1 and 4 weeks after TAC had cardiac hypertrophy and failure, respectively. Cardiac expression of ER chaperones was significantly increased 1 and 4 weeks after TAC, indicating that pressure overload by TAC induced prolonged ER stress. In addition, the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells increased, and caspase-3 was cleaved in failing hearts. The antagonism of angiotensin II type 1 receptor prevented upregulation of ER chaperones and apoptosis in failing hearts. On the other hand, angiotensin II upregulated ER chaperones and induced apoptosis in cultured adult rat cardiac myocytes. We also investigated possible signaling pathways for ER-initiated apoptosis. The CHOP- (a transcription factor induced by ER stress), but not JNK- or caspase-12-, dependent pathway was activated in failing hearts by TAC. Pharmacological ER stress inducers upregulated ER chaperones and induced apoptosis in cultured cardiac myocytes. Finally, mRNA levels of ER chaperones were markedly increased in failing hearts of patients with elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that pressure overload by TAC induces prolonged ER stress, which may contribute to cardiac myocyte apoptosis during progression from cardiac hypertrophy to failure.},

	Abstract = {The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signal transduction pathway induced by a variety of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses and functions to maintain homeostasis of the cellular membrane in eukaryotes. Various ER stresses result in the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, which is sensed by the transmembrane protein kinase/ribonuclease Ire1p that transmits a signal from the ER to the nucleus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we report that the yeast ER chaperone Kar2p/BiP, a member of the HSP70 family found in the ER, directly regulates the UPR by the interaction with Ire1p. In the absence of ER stress, Kar2p binds the lumenal domain of Ire1p and keeps Ire1p in an inactive unphosphorylated state. Upon exposure of cells to ER stresses, Kar2p is released from Ire1p, resulting in activation of Ire1p and signal transduction to the nucleus. Subsequently, KAR2 mRNA is induced and Kar2p accumulates in the ER in a time-dependent manner, restoring the system to the basal state. This negative autoregulation is similar to the regulation of mammalian cytosolic chaperone Hsp70 via its interaction with heat shock factor 1.},

	Abstract = {Proteins expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are subjected to a tight quality control. Persistent association with ER-resident molecular chaperones prevents exit of misfolded or incompletely assembled polypeptides from the ER and forward transport along the secretory line. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is in place to avoid ER constipation. Folding-incompetent products have to be identified to interrupt futile folding attempts and then targeted for unfolding and dislocation into the cytosol for proteasome-mediated destruction. These processes are better understood for N-glycosylated proteins that represent the majority of polypeptides expressed in the ER. EDEM, a mannosidase-like chaperone, regulates the extraction of misfolded glycoproteins from the calnexin cycle. Here we identify and characterize EDEM2, a novel, stress-regulated mannosidase-like protein that operates in the ER lumen. We show that transcriptional up-regulation of EDEM2 depends on the ER stress-activated transcription factor Xbp1, that EDEM2 up-regulation selectively accelerates ERAD of terminally misfolded glycoproteins by facilitating their extraction from the calnexin cycle, and that the previously characterized homolog EDEM is also a soluble protein of the ER lumen in HEK293 cells.},

	Abstract = {The expression of liver-specific genes is regulated by unequivocally allocated transcription factors via proper responsible elements within their promoters. We identified a novel transcription factor, CREB-H, and found that its expression was restricted in the liver among 16 human tissues tested. A region of CREB-H exhibited significant homology to the basic leucine zipper (b-Zip) domain of members of the CREB/ATF family: mammalian LZIP and Drosophila BBF-2 that binds to box-B, a Drosophila enhancer modulating the fat-body-specific gene expression. CREB-H contained a hydrophobic region representing a putative transmembrane domain, like LZIP. Constructing a variety of CREB-H fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain disclosed that CREB-H functioned as a transcriptional activator and its N-terminal 149 amino acids accounted for the activation ability. Gel mobility sift assays revealed that CREB-H did not bind to the C/EBP, AP-1 and NF-kappaB elements but specifically bound to CRE and the box-B element. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that like BBF-2, CREB-H activated transcription via the box-B element and that a deletion of the putative transmembrane domain increased the activation of reporter expression significantly. Furthermore, a fusion protein of GFP and full-length CREB-H was localized in reticular structures surrounding the nucleus, whereas a fusion protein of GFP and a deletion mutant lacking the putative transmembrane domain was mainly in the nucleus. These findings suggest that CREB-H plays an important role in transcriptional regulation of genes specifically expressed in the liver, and that the putative transmembrane domain may be associated with modulation of its function as the transcriptional activator.},

	Abstract = {The ER's capacity to process proteins is limited, and stress caused by accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins (ER stress) contributes to human disease. ER stress elicits the unfolded protein response (UPR), whose components attenuate protein synthesis, increase folding capacity, and enhance misfolded protein degradation. Here, we report that P58(IPK)/DNAJC3, a UPR-responsive gene previously implicated in translational control, encodes a cytosolic cochaperone that associates with the ER protein translocation channel Sec61. P58(IPK) recruits HSP70 chaperones to the cytosolic face of Sec61 and can be crosslinked to proteins entering the ER that are delayed at the translocon. Proteasome-mediated cytosolic degradation of translocating proteins delayed at Sec61 is cochaperone dependent. In P58(IPK-/-) mice, cells with a high secretory burden are markedly compromised in their ability to cope with ER stress. Thus, P58(IPK) is a key mediator of cotranslocational ER protein degradation, and this process likely contributes to ER homeostasis in stressed cells.},

	Abstract = {Excessive nitric oxide (NO) production in cytokine-activated beta cells has been implicated in beta cell disruption in type 1 diabetes. beta cells are very vulnerable to NO-induced apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. Low concentrations of NO that lead to apoptosis apparently do not cause severe DNA damage in mouse MIN6 beta cells. CHOP, a C/EBP homologous protein that is induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and plays a role in growth arrest and cell death, was induced by a NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP). SNAP increased cytosolic Ca(2+), and only agents depleting ER Ca(2+) induced CHOP expression and led to apoptosis, suggesting that NO depletes ER Ca(2+). Overexpression of calreticulin increased the Ca(2+) content of ER and afforded protection to cells against NO-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, pancreatic islets from CHOP knockout mice showed resistance to NO. We conclude that NO depletes ER Ca(2+), causes ER stress, and leads to apoptosis. Thus, ER Ca(2+) stores are a new target of NO, and the ER stress pathway is a major mechanism of NO-mediated beta cell apoptosis.},

Because beta cell mass declines under these conditions, apparently as a result of apoptosis, we speculated that overload kills beta cells as a result of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The Akita mouse, which carries a conformation-altering missense mutation (Cys96Tyr) in Insulin 2, likewise exhibits hyperglycemia and a reduced beta cell mass. In the development of diabetes in Akita mice, mRNAs for the ER chaperone Bip and the ER stress-associated apoptosis factor Chop were induced in the pancreas. Overexpression of the mutant insulin in mouse MIN6 beta cells induced Chop expression and led to apoptosis. Targeted disruption of the Chop gene delayed the onset of diabetes in heterozygous Akita mice by 8-10 weeks. We conclude that ER overload in beta cells causes ER stress and leads to apoptosis via Chop induction. Our findings suggest a new therapeutic approach for preventing the onset of diabetes by inhibiting Chop induction or by increasing chaperone capacity in the ER.},

Using cell culture and mouse models, we show that obesity causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

Mice deficient in X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), a transcription factor that modulates the ER stress response, develop insulin resistance. These findings demonstrate that ER stress is a central feature of peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels.

	Abstract = {The heat shock protein 70 and glucose-regulated protein 78 have been shown to protect cells against deleterious stimuli. This study was performed to determine whether endothelin-1 pretreatment could increase cardiomyocyte tolerance to hypoxia and induce heat shock protein 70 and glucose-regulated protein 78 expression. Cultured cardiomyocytes were treated with endothelin-1 at doses of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 nmol/L for 10 minutes followed by 10 minutes endothelin-1-free normal medium prior to 12 hours hypoxia. Lactate dehydrogenase activity and malondialdehyde level in the medium were determined at the end of hypoxia, and myocyte heat shock protein 70 and glucose-regulated protein 78 were assayed with Western blot. Lactate dehydrogenase activity and malondialdehyde content in the medium were significantly elevated after hypoxia (P < 0.01, n = 6). Heat shock protein 70 and glucoseregulated protein 78 expression in cardiomyocytes also increased significantly after hypoxia (P < 0.01 vs control, n = 3). Endothelin- 1 pretreatment reduced lactate dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde after hypoxia, and increased heat shock protein 70 and glucoseregulated protein 78 levels during normal culture and hypoxia. Glucose-regulated protein 78 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide partially abrogated the protective effect of endothelin-1 pretreatment on hypoxic cardiomyocyte injury. This study indicated that endothelin-1 pretreatment could protect hypoxic cardiomyocytes and might exert this effect through upregulation of heat shock protein 70 and glucose-regulated protein 78.},

	Abstract = {Unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum cause trans-autophosphorylation of the bifunctional transmembrane kinase Ire1, which induces its endoribonuclease activity. The endoribonuclease initiates nonconventional splicing of HAC1 messenger RNA to trigger the unfolded-protein response (UPR). We explored the role of Ire1's kinase domain by sensitizing it through site-directed mutagenesis to the ATP-competitive inhibitor 1NM-PP1. Paradoxically, rather than being inhibited by 1NM-PP1, drug-sensitized Ire1 mutants required 1NM-PP1 as a cofactor for activation. In the presence of 1NM-PP1, drug-sensitized Ire1 bypassed mutations that inactivate its kinase activity and induced a full UPR. Thus, rather than through phosphorylation per se, a conformational change in the kinase domain triggered by occupancy of the active site with a ligand leads to activation of all known downstream functions.},

	Abstract = {Signal transduction networks have only been studied at a small scale because large-scale reconstructions and suitable in silico analysis methods have not been available. Since reconstructions of large signaling networks are progressing well there is now a need to develop a framework for analysing structural properties of signaling networks. One such framework is presented here, one that is based on systemically independent pathways and a mass-balanced representation of signaling events. This approach was applied to a prototypic signaling network and it allowed for: (1) a systemic analysis of all possible input/output relationships, (2) a quantitative evaluation of network crosstalk, or the interconnectivity of systemically independent pathways, (3) a measure of the redundancy in the signaling network, (4) the participation of reactions in signaling pathways, and (5) the calculation of correlated reaction sets. These properties emerge from network structure and can only be derived and studied within a defined mathematical framework. The calculations presented are the first of their kind for a signaling network, while similar analysis has been extensively performed for prototypic and genome-scale metabolic networks. This approach does not yet account for dynamic concentration profiles. Due to the scalability of the stoichiometric formalism used, the results presented for the prototypic signaling network can be obtained for large signaling networks once their reconstruction is completed.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glucose deprivation, a feature of poorly vascularized solid tumors, activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress-signaling pathway, in tumor cells. We recently isolated a novel macrocyclic compound, versipelostatin (VST), that inhibits transcription from the promoter of GRP78, a gene that is activated as part of the UPR. We examined the effect of VST on the UPR induced by glucose deprivation or other stressors and on tumor growth in vivo. METHODS: Human colon cancer HT-29, fibrosarcoma HT1080, and stomach cancer MKN74 cells were cultured in the absence of glucose or in the presence of glucose and a UPR-inducing chemical stressor (the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, the calcium ionophore A23187, or the hypoglycemia-mimicking agent 2-deoxyglucose [2DG]). The effect of VST on UPR induction was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis of the UPR target genes GRP78 and GRP94; by immunoblot analysis of the UPR transcriptional activators ATF6, XBP1, and ATF4; and by analyzing reporter gene expression in cells transiently transfected with a GRP78 promoter-reporter gene. Cell sensitivity to VST was examined with a colony formation assay and flow cytometry. In vivo antitumor activity of VST was assessed with an MKN74 xenograft model. RESULTS: VST inhibited expression of UPR target genes in glucose-deprived or 2DG-treated cells but not in cells treated with tunicamycin or A23187. VST also inhibited the production of the UPR transcriptional activators XBP1 and ATF4 during glucose deprivation. The UPR-inhibitory action of VST was seen only in conditions of glucose deprivation and caused selective and massive killing of the glucose-deprived cells. VST alone and in combination with cisplatin statistically significantly (P =.004 and P<.001 for comparisons with untreated control, respectively) inhibited tumor growth of MKN74 xenografts. CONCLUSION: Disruption of the UPR may provide a novel therapeutic approach to targeting glucose-deprived solid tumors.},

	Abstract = {An unconventional mechanism for retaining improperly folded glycoproteins and facilitating acquisition of their native tertiary and quaternary structures operates in the endoplasmic reticulum. Recognition of folding glycoproteins by two resident lectins, membrane-bound calnexin and its soluble homolog, calreticulin, is mediated by protein-linked monoglucosylated oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides contain glucose (Glc), mannose (Man), and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the general form Glc1Man7-9GlcNAc2. They are formed by glucosidase I- and II-catalyzed partial deglucosylation of the oligosaccharide transferred from dolichol diphosphate derivatives to Asn residues in nascent polypeptide chains (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2). Further deglucosylation of the oligosaccharides by glucosidase II liberates glycoproteins from their calnexin/calreticulin anchors. Monoglucosylated glycans are then recreated by the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT), and thus recognized again by the lectins, only when linked to improperly folded protein moieties, as GT behaves as a sensor of glycoprotein conformations. The deglucosylation-reglucosylation cycle continues until proper folding is achieved. The lectin-monoglucosylated oligosaccharide interaction is one of the alternative ways by which cells retain improperly folded glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it decreases the folding rate, it increases folding efficiency, prevents premature glycoprotein oligomerization and degradation, and suppresses formation of non-native disulfide bonds by hindering aggregation and thus allowing interaction of protein moieties of folding glycoproteins with classical chaperones and other proteins that assist in folding.},

	Abstract = {The expression of the gene encoding the C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), which is also known as growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gene 153 (gadd153), has been shown to be specifically activated under conditions that disturb the functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To investigate a possible role of ER dysfunction in the pathological process of ischemic cell damage, we studied ischemia-induced changes in gadd153 expression using quantitative PCR. Transient cerebral ischemia was produced in rats by four-vessel occlusion. In the hippocampus, ischemia induced a pronounced increase in gadd153 mRNA levels, peaking at 8 h of recovery (6.4-fold increase, p<0.01), whereas changes in the cortex were less marked (non-significant increase). To elucidate the possible mechanism underlying this activation process, gadd153 mRNA levels were also evaluated in primary neuronal cell cultures under two different conditions, both leading to a depletion of ER calcium pools in the presence or absence of an increase in cytoplasmic calcium activity. The first procedure, exposure to thapsigargin, an irreversible inhibitor of ER Ca2+-ATPase, caused a marked increase in gadd153 mRNA levels both in cortical and hippocampal neurons, peaking at 12-18 h after treatment. The second procedure, immersion of cells in calcium free medium supplemented with EGTA, caused only a transient increase in gadd153 mRNA levels, peaking at 6 h of recovery, indicating that a depletion of ER calcium stores in the absence of an increase in cytoplasmic calcium activity is sufficient to activate neuronal gadd153 expression. The results imply that transient cerebral ischemia disturbs the functioning of the ER and that these pathological changes are more pronounced in the hippocampus compared to the cortex.},

	Abstract = {P58/DNAJc3 defends cells against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Most P58 molecules are translocated into the ER lumen, and here we report selective and stable binding to misfolded proteins by P58's TPR-containing N-terminal domain. In vitro, too, P58 binds selectively to a model misfolded protein and challenge of that complex with physiological concentrations of the ER lumenal Hsp70-type chaperone BiP encourages disassembly. BiP-induced dissociation of P58 from its substrate depends on the presence of ATP and on interactions with P58's J-domain, which are mediated by invariant residues BiP(R197) and P58(H422). A functional J-domain also accelerates dissociation of P58 from a model substrate, VSV-G(ts045), on the latter's re-folding in vivo. However, J-domain binding can be separated from the ability to promote substrate dissociation by the mutant BiP(E201G) and a wild-type J-domain fused ectopically to P58(H422Q) rescues the latter's inability to dissociate from substrate in response to BiP and ATP. These findings are consistent with a model whereby localized activation of the Hsp70-type partner is sufficient to promote substrate handover from the J-domain co-chaperone.},

	Abstract = {One hypothesis for the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is that subsets of neurons are vulnerable to a failure in proteasome-mediated protein turnover. Here we show that overexpression of mutant alpha-synuclein increases sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors by decreasing proteasome function. Overexpression of parkin decreases sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors in a manner dependent on parkin's ubiquitin-protein E3 ligase activity, and antisense knockdown of parkin increases sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. Mutant alpha-synuclein also causes selective toxicity to catecholaminergic neurons in primary midbrain cultures, an effect that can be mimicked by the application of proteasome inhibitors. Parkin is capable of rescuing the toxic effects of mutant alpha-synuclein or proteasome inhibition in these cells. Therefore, parkin and alpha-synuclein are linked by common effects on a pathway associated with selective cell death in catecholaminergic neurons.},

	Abstract = {Coagulation factors V and VIII are homologous glycosylated plasma proteins that provide essential functions for hemostasis. Factor V is secreted as a single chain polypeptide, whereas factor VIII is processed intracellularly to yield a metal-ion-associated heterodimer that is stabilized through interaction with von Willebrand factor. In transfected mammalian cells, factor V is more efficiently secreted than factor VIII. To provide insight into the different secretion efficiencies, we compared the post-translational processing requirements for factor V and factor VIII expressed in mammalian cells. In contrast to factor VIII, factor V was not detected in association with the immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), a chaperonin protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Depletion of intracellular ATP levels by treatment of cells with low concentrations of carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), protonophore that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, inhibited secretion of factor VIII but had no effect on the secretion of factor V. Inhibition of N-linked oligosaccharide addition by treatment with tunicamycin prevented secretion of both factor V and factor VIII, whereas treatment with an inhibitor of complex oligosaccharide addition, deoxymannojirimycin, did not affect secretion, although the specific activities of both factor V and factor VIII were slightly increased. Thus, complex oligosaccharide addition was not required for secretion or functional activity of either factor V or factor VIII. Depletion of intralumenal calcium with the ionophore A23187 did not affect secretion of either factor V or factor VIII. In the presence of A23187, the secreted factor V was fully functional, whereas the factor VIII heavy and light chains were not associated and the secreted molecule was inactive. In addition, A23187 treatment inhibited addition of serine/threonine (O)-linked oligosaccharides to factor V and factor VIII. The differences between factor V and factor VIII were further evaluated by characterization of a single chain mutant factor VIII. The single chain factor VIII was secreted with an efficiency similar to wild-type factor VIII and also required von Willebrand factor for stabilization. In addition, the activity of single chain factor VIII was also inhibited by A23187 treatment, suggesting a unique metal-ion requirement within the secretory pathway for functional factor VIII folding. The differences identified in BiP association, ATP requirements, and metal-ion dependence for effective functional secretion of these two molecules may underlie mechanisms accounting for their different secretion efficiencies.},

Here, we report that TFD caused not only induction but also phosphorylation of BIM(EL). Mitochondrially localized JNKs but not upstream activators, like mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs), specifically phosphorylated BIM(EL) at Ser65, potentiating its proapoptotic activity. Inhibition of the JNK pathway attenuated BIM(EL) expression, prevented BIM(EL) phosphorylation, and abrogated TFD-induced apoptosis. Conversely, activation of this pathway promoted BIM(EL) expression and phosphorylation, causing BIM- and BAX-dependent cell death. Thus, JNKs regulate the proapoptotic activity of BIM(EL) during TFD, both transcriptionally and posttranslationally.},

	Abstract = {Trophic factor deprivation (TFD) activates c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), culminating in coordinate AP1-dependent transactivation of the BH3-only BCL-2 proteins BIM(EL) and HRK, which in turn are critical for BAX-dependent cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis. Here, we report that TFD caused not only induction but also phosphorylation of BIM(EL). Mitochondrially localized JNKs but not upstream activators, like mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs), specifically phosphorylated BIM(EL) at Ser65, potentiating its proapoptotic activity. Inhibition of the JNK pathway attenuated BIM(EL) expression, prevented BIM(EL) phosphorylation, and abrogated TFD-induced apoptosis. Conversely, activation of this pathway promoted BIM(EL) expression and phosphorylation, causing BIM- and BAX-dependent cell death. Thus, JNKs regulate the proapoptotic activity of BIM(EL) during TFD, both transcriptionally and posttranslationally.},

	Abstract = {Bcl-2 family members that have only a single Bcl-2 homology domain, BH3, are potent inducers of apoptosis, and some appear to play a critical role in developmentally programmed cell death. We examined the regulation of the proapoptotic activity of the BH3-only protein Bim. In healthy cells, most Bim molecules were bound to LC8 cytoplasmic dynein light chain and thereby sequestered to the microtubule-associated dynein motor complex. Certain apoptotic stimuli disrupted the interaction between LC8 and the dynein motor complex. This freed Bim to translocate together with LC8 to Bcl-2 and to neutralize its antiapoptotic activity. This process did not require caspase activity and therefore constitutes an initiating event in apoptosis signaling.},

	Abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by misfolded proteins or cytotoxic drugs can kill cells and although activation of this pathway has been implicated in the etiology of certain degenerative disorders its mechanism remains unresolved. Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family is required for initiation of apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation or certain stress stimuli. Its proapoptotic activity can be regulated by several transcriptional or posttranslational mechanisms, such as ERK-mediated phosphorylation, promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We found that Bim is essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis in a diverse range of cell types both in culture and within the whole animal. ER stress activates Bim through two novel pathways, involving protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation, which prevents its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and CHOP-C/EBPalpha-mediated direct transcriptional induction. These results define the molecular mechanisms of ER stress-induced apoptosis and identify targets for therapeutic intervention in ER stress-related diseases.},

	Abstract = {HIV type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors (PI) have been shown to have anticancer activity in non-HIV-associated human cancer cells. The underlying mechanism of this effect is unclear. Here, we show that the PIs nelfinavir and atazanavir cause cell death in various malignant glioma cell lines in vitro. The underlying mechanism of this antitumor effect involves the potent stimulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (ESR), as indicated by increased expression of two ESR markers, GRP78 and CHOP, and activation of ESR-associated caspase-4. Induction of ESR seems to play a central role in PI-induced cell death because small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the protective ER chaperone GRP78 sensitizes cells; whereas knockdown of proapoptotic caspase-4 protects cells from PI-induced cell death. Furthermore, the treatment of cells with PIs leads to aggresome formation and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, implying proteasome inhibition. Thus, our results support a model whereby PIs cause tumor cell death via triggering of the ESR, inhibition of proteasome activity, and subsequent accumulation of misfolded proteins. Inhibition of glioma growth via ESR takes place in the in vivo setting as well, as nelfinavir inhibits the growth of xenografted human malignant glioma, with concomitant induction of the proapoptotic ER stress marker CHOP. Because ER stress has also been reported as the mechanism for insulin resistance and diabetes, our ER stress model of PI function may also explain why these drugs may induce insulin resistance as one of their most common side effects.},

	Abstract = {The assembly of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules involves the association of heavy (H) chain with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) and peptide. Unassembled class I H chains do not exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and this is exemplified by the beta 2m-deficient human melanoma FO-1 where free class I H chains are unable to complete assembly. In pulse chase experiments involving FO-1 cells, unassembled free class I H chains were shown to be stably associated with calnexin (IP90/p88), a 90-kD integral membrane molecular chaperone of the ER. To establish a role for calnexin in mediating this retention, we transfected FO-1 cells with a cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant of calnexin. Since the cytoplasmic tail contains the ER retention motif, these mutant calnexin molecules leave the ER and progress to the cell surface. In these stable transfectants of FO-1, free class I H chains also exited the ER and trafficked to the cell surface with calnexin, thus establishing a role for calnexin in the quality control of MHC class I assembly through mediating the ER retention of incompletely assembled class I H chains.},

Truncation mutants of calnexin, when transiently expressed in COS cells, were exported from the ER and either accumulated in the Golgi or progressed to the cell surface. CD3 epsilon chains cotransfected with the forms of calnexin that were not retained in the ER exited the ER and colocalized with calnexin.

RNA interference and dominant-negative expression studies revealed that both BiP and PERK signaling promote survival and drug resistance of dormant cells, and that BiP up-regulation prevents Bax activation. We propose that stress-dependent activation of p38 via BiP up-regulation and PERK activation protects dormant tumor cells from stress insults, such as chemotherapy.},

	Abstract = {Cyclin D1 plays a critical role in controlling the G(1)/S transition via the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Several studies have indicated that cyclin D1 translation is decreased upon activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) kinases. We examined the effect of activation of the eIF2alpha kinases PKR and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) on cyclin D1 protein levels and translation and determined that cyclin D1 protein levels decrease upon the induction of PKR and PERK catalytic activity but that this decrease is not due to translation. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome with MG132 rescued cyclin D1 protein levels, indicating that rather than inhibiting translation, PKR and PERK act to increase cyclin D1 degradation. Interestingly, this effect still requires eIF2alpha phosphorylation at serine 51, as cyclin D1 remains unaffected in cells containing a non-phosphorylatable form of the protein. This proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 requires an intact ubiquitination pathway, although the ubiquitination of cyclin D1 is not itself affected. Furthermore, this degradation is independent of phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine 286, which is mediated by the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways as described in previous studies. Our study reveals a novel functional cross-talk between eIF2alpha phosphorylation and the proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 and that this degradation is dependent upon eIF2alpha phosphorylation during short, but not prolonged, periods of stress.},

	Abstract = {A large number of correlative studies have established that the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) alters the cell's sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Although the induction of the glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) is commonly used as an indicator for the UPR, the direct role of the GRPs in conferring resistance to DNA damaging agents has not been proven. We report here that without the use of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers, specific overexpression of GRP78 results in reduced apoptosis and higher colony survival when challenged with topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and doxorubicin, and topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. While investigating the mechanism for the GRP78 protective effect against etoposide-induced cell death, we discovered that in contrast to the UPR, GRP78 overexpression does not result in G1 arrest or depletion of topoisomerase II. Caspase-7, an executor caspase that is associated with the ER, is activated by etoposide. We show here that specific expression of GRP78 blocks caspase-7 activation by etoposide both in vivo and in vitro, and this effect can be reversed by addition of dATP in a cell-free system. Recently, it was reported that ectopically expressed GRP78 and caspases-7 and -12 form a complex, thus coupling ER stress to the cell death program. However, the mechanism of how GRP78, a presumably ER lumen protein, can regulate cytosolic effectors of apoptosis is not known. Here we provide evidence that a subpopulation of GRP78 can exist as an ER transmembrane protein, as well as co-localize with caspase-7, as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Co-immunoprecipitation studies further reveal endogenous GRP78 constitutively associates with procaspase-7 but not with procaspase-3. Lastly, a GRP78 mutant deleted of its ATP binding domain fails to bind procaspase-7 and loses its protective effect against etoposide-induced apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Accumulation of abnormal proteins occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease (HD). However, the precise role of protein aggregation in neuronal cell death remains unclear. We show here that the expression of N-terminal huntingtin proteins with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats causes cell death in neuronal PC6.3 cell that involves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These mutant huntingtin fragment proteins elevated Bip, an ER chaperone, and increased Chop and the phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) that are involved in cell death regulation. Caspase-12, residing in the ER, was cleaved in mutant huntingtin expressing cells, as was caspase-3 mediating cell death. In contrast, cytochrome-c or apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) was not released from mitochondria after the expression of these proteins. Treatment with salubrinal that inhibits ER stress counteracted cell death and reduced protein aggregations in the PC6.3 cells caused by the mutant huntingtin fragment proteins. Salubrinal upregulated Bip, reduced cleavage of caspase-12 and increased the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 subunit-alpha (eIF2alpha) that are neuroprotective. These results show that N-terminal mutant huntingtin proteins activate cellular pathways linked to ER stress, and that inhibition of ER stress by salubrinal increases cell survival. The data suggests that compounds targeting ER stress may be considered in designing novel approaches for treatment of HD and possibly other polyQ diseases.},

	Abstract = {The hypoxic response is an ancient stress response triggered by low ambient oxygen (O2) (ref. 1) and controlled by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1), whose alpha subunit is rapidly degraded under normoxia but stabilized when O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) that target its O2-dependent degradation domain are inhibited. Thus, the amount of HIF-1alpha, which controls genes involved in energy metabolism and angiogenesis, is regulated post-translationally. Another ancient stress response is the innate immune response, regulated by several transcription factors, among which NF-kappaB plays a central role. NF-kappaB activation is controlled by IkappaB kinases (IKK), mainly IKK-beta, needed for phosphorylation-induced degradation of IkappaB inhibitors in response to infection and inflammation. IKK-beta is modestly activated in hypoxic cell cultures when PHDs that attenuate its activation are inhibited. However, defining the relationship between NF-kappaB and HIF-1alpha has proven elusive. Using in vitro systems, it was reported that HIF-1alpha activates NF-kappaB, that NF-kappaB controls HIF-1alpha transcription and that HIF-1alpha activation may be concurrent with inhibition of NF-kappaB. Here we show, with the use of mice lacking IKK-beta in different cell types, that NF-kappaB is a critical transcriptional activator of HIF-1alpha and that basal NF-kappaB activity is required for HIF-1alpha protein accumulation under hypoxia in cultured cells and in the liver and brain of hypoxic animals. IKK-beta deficiency results in defective induction of HIF-1alpha target genes including vascular endothelial growth factor. IKK-beta is also essential for HIF-1alpha accumulation in macrophages experiencing a bacterial infection. Hence, IKK-beta is an important physiological contributor to the hypoxic response, linking it to innate immunity and inflammation.},

	Abstract = {Hypoxia within solid tumors is a major determinant of outcome after anticancer therapy. Analysis of gene expression changes during hypoxia indicated that unfolded protein response genes were one of the most robustly induced groups of genes. In this study, we investigated the hypoxic regulation of X-box binding protein (XBP1), a major transcriptional regulator of the unfolded protein response. Hypoxia induced XBP1 at the transcriptional level and activated splicing of its mRNA, resulting in increased levels of activated XBP1 protein. After exposure to hypoxia, apoptosis increased and clonogenic survival decreased in XBP1-deficient cells. Loss of XBP1 severely inhibited tumor growth due to a reduced capacity for these transplanted tumor cells to survive in a hypoxic microenvironment. Taken together, these studies directly implicate XBP1 as an essential survival factor for hypoxic stress and tumor growth.},

	Abstract = {We report on the identification of a nuclear protein that serves as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the transcription factors C/EBP and LAP. A 32P-labeled LAP DNA-binding and dimerization domain "zipper probe" was used to isolate a clone that encodes a new C/EBP-homologous protein: CHOP-10. CHOP-10 has strong sequence similarity to C/EBP-like proteins within the bZIP region corresponding to the DNA-binding domain consisting of a leucine zipper and a basic region. Notably, however, CHOP-10 contains 2 prolines substituting for 2 residues in the basic region, critical for binding to DNA. Thus, heterodimers of CHOP-10 and C/EBP-like proteins are unable to bind their cognate DNA enhancer element. CHOP-10 mRNA is expressed in many different rat tissues. Antisera raised against CHOP-10 recognize a nuclear protein with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kD. CHOP-10 is induced upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes, and cytokine-induced dedifferentiation of adipocytes is preceded by the loss of nuclear CHOP-10. Coimmunoprecipitation of CHOP-10 and LAP from transfected COS-1 cells demonstrated a direct interaction between the two proteins, in vivo. Consistent with the structure of its defective basic region, bacterially expressed CHOP-10 inhibits the DNA-binding activity of C/EBP and LAP by forming heterodimers that cannot bind DNA. In transfected HepG2 cells, expression of CHOP-10 attenuates activation of C/EBP- and LAP-driven promoters. We suggest that CHOP-10 is a negative modulator of the activity of C/EBP-like proteins in certain terminally differentiated cells, similar to the regulatory function of Id on the activity of MyoD and MyoD-related proteins important in the development of muscle cells.},

	Abstract = {6-hydroxydopamine, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP+), and rotenone cause the death of dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in vivo and are widely used to model Parkinson's disease. To identify regulated genes in such models, we performed serial analysis of gene expression on neuronal PC12 cells exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine. This revealed a striking increase in transcripts associated with the unfolded protein response. Immunoblotting confirmed phosphorylation of the key endoplasmic reticulum stress kinases IRE1alpha and PERK (PKR-like ER kinase) and induction of their downstream targets. There was a similar response to MPP+ and rotenone, but not to other apoptotic initiators. As evidence that endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to neuronal death, sympathetic neurons from PERK null mice in which the capacity to respond to endoplasmic reticulum stress is compromised were more sensitive to 6-hydroxydopamine. Our findings, coupled with evidence from familial forms of Parkinson's disease, raise the possibility of widespread involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response in the pathophysiology of this disease.},

	Abstract = {Caspases function in both apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine processing and thereby have a role in resistance to sepsis. Here we describe a novel role for a caspase in dampening responses to bacterial infection. We show that in mice, gene-targeted deletion of caspase-12 renders animals resistant to peritonitis and septic shock. The resulting survival advantage was conferred by the ability of the caspase-12-deficient mice to clear bacterial infection more efficiently than wild-type littermates. Caspase-12 dampened the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-18 (interferon (IFN)-gamma inducing factor) and IFN-gamma, but not tumour-necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6, in response to various bacterial components that stimulate Toll-like receptor and NOD pathways. The IFN-gamma pathway was crucial in mediating survival of septic caspase-12-deficient mice, because administration of neutralizing antibodies to IFN-gamma receptors ablated the survival advantage that otherwise occurred in these animals. Mechanistically, caspase-12 associated with caspase-1 and inhibited its activity. Notably, the protease function of caspase-12 was not necessary for this effect, as the catalytically inactive caspase-12 mutant Cys299Ala also inhibited caspase-1 and IL-1beta production to the same extent as wild-type caspase-12. In this regard, caspase-12 seems to be the cFLIP counterpart for regulating the inflammatory branch of the caspase cascade. In mice, caspase-12 deficiency confers resistance to sepsis and its presence exerts a dominant-negative suppressive effect on caspase-1, resulting in enhanced vulnerability to bacterial infection and septic mortality.},

It consists of an unstructured basic segment (residues 1-118) and a 149 residue serine protease module (SFVP, residues 119-267) comprised of two beta-barrel domains. Previous in vivo and in vitro translation experiments have demonstrated that SFVP folds co-translationally during synthesis of the viral polyprotein and rapidly cleaves itself off the nascent chain. To test whether fast co-translation folding of SFVP is an intrinsic property of the polypeptide chain or whether folding is accelerated by cellular components, we investigated spontaneous folding of recombinant SFVP in vitro. The results show that the majority of unfolded SFVP molecules fold faster than any previously studied two-domain protein (tau=50 ms), and that folding of the N-terminal domain precedes structure formation of the C-terminal domain. This shows that co-translational folding of SFVP does not require additional cellular components and suggests that rapid folding is the result of molecular evolution towards efficient virus biogenesis.},

	Abstract = {Pancreatic beta-cell failure is increasingly recognized as central to the progression of diabetes mellitus. Different causes are implicated in the onset of beta-cell stress, dysfunction or death. Recent genetic and biochemical evidence both in humans and mice shows that failure in modulating the capacity and quality of the endoplasmic reticulum protein-folding machinery leads to beta-cell death. The quality control of protein-folding is regulated by several signaling pathways, which are collectively termed the unfolded protein response. In beta-cells proinsulin represents up to 50\% of the total protein synthesis, and the rate of glucose-stimulated proinsulin translation is approximately 1 million molecules per minute per cell. When proinsulin folding is disrupted, the high burden imposed by proinsulin synthesis on the unfolded protein response is considered the leading cause of certain diabetes phenotypes. We have developed a model of the unfolded protein response to investigate the factors that can prevent misfolded protein accumulation. We also present predictions for therapeutic strategies to ameliorate pancreatic beta-cell death in diabetes patients.},

When protein folding in the ER is inhibited, signal transduction pathways, which increase the biosynthetic capacity and decrease the biosynthetic burden of the ER to maintain the homeostasis of this organelle, are activated. These pathways are called the unfolded protein response (UPR). In this review, we briefly summarize principles of protein folding and molecular chaperone function important for a mechanistic understanding of UPR-signaling events. We then discuss mechanisms of signal transduction employed by the UPR in mammals and our current understanding of the remodeling of cellular processes by the UPR. Finally, we summarize data that demonstrate that UPR signaling feeds into decision making in other processes previously thought to be unrelated to ER function, e.g., eukaryotic starvation responses and differentiation programs.},

We have used this concept to analyze the interplay between the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycolysis. The set of elementary modes for this system involves conventional glycolysis, a futile cycle, all the modes of PPP function described in biochemistry textbooks, and additional modes that are a priori equally entitled to pathway status. Applications include maximizing product yield in amino acid and antibiotic synthesis, reconstruction and consistency checks of metabolism from genome data, analysis of enzyme deficiencies, and drug target identification in metabolic networks.},

	Abstract = {The transmembrane kinase Ire1p is required for activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), the increase in transcription of genes encoding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins that occurs in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Ire1p spans the ER membrane (or the nuclear membrane with which the ER is continuous), with its kinase domain localized in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. Consistent with this arrangement, it has been proposed that Ire1p senses the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER and transmits the signal across the membrane toward the transcription machinery, possibly by phosphorylating downstream components of the UPR pathway. Molecular genetic and biochemical studies described here suggest that, as in the case of growth factor receptors of higher eukaryotic cells, Ire1p oligomerizes in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER and is phosphorylated in trans by other Ire1p molecules as a result of oligomerization. In addition to its kinase domain, a C-terminal tail domain of Ire1p is required for induction of the UPR. The role of the tail is probably to bind other proteins that transmit the unfolded protein signal to the nucleus.},

Previous studies in our laboratory found that chronic treatment with the mood stabilizing drug valproate in rat brain increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins GRP78, GRP94 and calreticulin. We report here that in primary cultured rat cerebral cortical cells, expression of GRP78, GRP94 and calreticulin are increased not only by valproate, but also by lithium after chronic treatment for 1 week at therapeutically relevant concentrations. However, two other mood stabilizing drugs carbamazepine and lamotrigine had no effect on expression of GRP78, GRP94 or calreticulin. Chronic treatment with lithium for 1 week increased both mRNA and protein levels of ER stress proteins. In contrast to a classic GRP78 inducer thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the ER Ca2+ -ATPase, chronic treatment with lithium or valproate for 1 week modestly increased GRP78 expression in neuronal cells, had no effect on basal intracellular free Ca2+ concentration and does not induce cell death. These results indicate that lithium and valproate may increase expression of GRP78, GRP94 and calreticulin in primary cultured rat cerebral cortical cells without causing cell damage. These results also suggest that the mechanism of GRP78 increase induced by lithium and valproate may be different from that of thapsigargin.},

Upon ER stress, ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi where it is processed to its active form. We have found that the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 binds ATF6 and dissociates in response to ER stress. Loss of BiP binding correlates with the translocation of ATF6 to the Golgi, which was slowed in cells overexpressing BiP. Two Golgi localization signals (GLSs) were identified in ATF6. Removal of BiP binding sites from ATF6, while retaining a GLS, resulted in its constitutive translocation to the Golgi. These results suggest that BiP retains ATF6 in the ER by inhibiting its GLSs and that dissociation of BiP during ER stress allows ATF6 to be transported to the Golgi.},

	Abstract = {ATF6 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored transcription factor activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the ER stress response. The release of the cytosolic transcription factor domain of ATF6 requires the sequential processing by the Golgi site-1 and site-2 proteases (S1P and S2P). It has been unclear why S2P proteolysis relies on previous site-1 cleavage. One possibility is that S2P localizes to a different cellular compartment than S1P; however, here we show that S2P localizes to the same compartment as S1P, the cis/medial-Golgi. In addition, we have re-localized S1P and S2P to the ER with brefeldin A and find that the sequential cleavage of ATF6 is reconstituted in the ER. The mapping of the region of ATF6 required for sequential S1P and S2P cleavage showed that short luminal domains resulted in S1P-independent S2P cleavage. The addition of artificial domains onto these short ATF6 luminal domains restored the S1P dependence of S2P cleavage, suggesting that it is the size rather than specific sequences in the luminal domain that determines the S1P dependence of S2P cleavage. These results suggest that the bulky ATF6 luminal domain blocks S2P cleavage and that the role of S1P is to reduce the size of the luminal domain to prepare ATF6 to be an optimal S2P substrate.},

In mammals, the phosphorylation was shown to be carried out by eIF-2alpha kinases PKR and HRI. We report the identification and characterization of a cDNA from rat pancreatic islet cells that encodes a new related kinase, which we term pancreatic eIF-2alpha kinase, or PEK. In addition to a catalytic domain with sequence and structural features conserved among eIF-2alpha kinases, PEK contains a distinctive amino-terminal region 550 residues in length. Using recombinant PEK produced in Escherichia coli or Sf-9 insect cells, we demonstrate that PEK is autophosphorylated on both serine and threonine residues and that the recombinant enzyme can specifically phosphorylate eIF-2alpha on serine-51. Northern blot analyses indicate that PEK mRNA is expressed in all tissues examined, with highest levels in pancreas cells. Consistent with our mRNA assays, PEK activity was predominantly detected in pancreas and pancreatic islet cells. The regulatory role of PEK in protein synthesis was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The addition of recombinant PEK to reticulocyte lysates caused a dose-dependent inhibition of translation. In the Saccharomyces model system, PEK functionally substituted for the endogenous yeast eIF-2alpha kinase, GCN2, by a process requiring the serine-51 phosphorylation site in eIF-2alpha. We also identified PEK homologs from both Caenorhabditis elegans and the puffer fish Fugu rubripes, suggesting that this eIF-2alpha kinase plays an important role in translational control from nematodes to mammals.},

The phosphorylation is carried out in part by three distinct eIF-2alpha kinases including mammalian double-stranded RNA-dependent eIF-2alpha kinase (PKR) and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI), and yeast GCN2. We report the identification and characterization of a related kinase, PEK, which shares common features with other eIF-2alpha kinases including phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha in vitro. We show that human PEK is regulated by different mechanisms than PKR or HRI. In contrast to PKR or HRI, which are dependent on autophosphorylation for their kinase activity, a point mutation that replaced the conserved Lys-614 with an alanine completely abolished the eIF-2alpha kinase activity, whereas the mutant PEK was still autophosphorylated when expressed in Sf-9 cells. Northern blot analysis indicates that PEK mRNA was predominantly expressed in pancreas, though low expression was also present in several tissues. Consistent with the high levels of mRNA in pancreas, the PEK protein was only detected in human pancreatic islets, and the kinase co-localized with somatostatin, a pancreatic delta cell-specific hormone. Thus PEK is believed to play an important role in regulating protein synthesis in the pancreatic islet, especially in islet delta cells.},

In a rat coronary artery occlusion model, the GRP78 protein level increased to 210\% of the sham level by early IP with three cycles of 4-min ischemia and 4-min reperfusion. The IP reduced infarct size in subsequent lethal ischemia. In primary cardiomyocytes, the simulated IP procedure, incubation in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) medium, also increased the GRP78 expression and suppressed the cell death caused by lethal ischemia. Transfection of grp78 antisense oligonucleotide attenuated the IP-mediated resistance to ischemia. This study showed for the first time that early IP up-regulates myocardial GRP78.

Grp78 is a molecular chaperone involved in the unfolded protein response, the expression of which can be regulated by the transcription factors ATF6 and XBP1. Thus, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of the grp78 gene in liver malignancy. METHODS: Expression of grp78, ATF6 and XBP1 was examined by Northern blot, RT-PCR, immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses. A reporter assay of the grp78 promoter was also performed. RESULTS: Elevation of grp78 and ATF6 mRNAs and the splicing of XBP1 mRNA, resulting in the activation of XBP1 product, occurred in HCC tissues with increased histological grading. Higher accumulation of the grp78 product in the cytoplasm, concomitantly with marked nuclear localization of the activated ATF6 product (p50ATF6), was observed in moderately to poorly differentiated HCC tissues. Cooperation between the distal DNA segment and the proximal endoplasmic reticulum stress response elements was essential for maximum transcription of the grp78 promoter in HCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: The endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway mediated by ATF6 and by IRE1-XBP1 systems seems essential for the transformation-associated expression of the grp78 gene in HCCs.},

As a key regulatory step in this signaling pathway, the mRNA encoding the UPR-specific transcription factor Hac1p becomes spliced by a unique mechanism that requires tRNA ligase but not the spliceosome. Splicing is initiated upon activation of Ire1p, a transmembrane kinase that lies in the ER and/or inner nuclear membrane. We show that Ire1p is a bifunctional enzyme: in addition to being a kinase, it is a site-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves HAC1 mRNA specifically at both splice junctions. The addition of purified tRNA ligase completes splicing; we therefore have reconstituted HAC1 mRNA splicing in vitro from purified components.},

	Abstract = {The unfolded protein response (UPR) controls the levels of molecular chaperones and enzymes involved in protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We recently isolated ATF6 as a candidate for mammalian UPR-specific transcription factor. We report here that ATF6 constitutively expressed as a 90-kDa protein (p90ATF6) is directly converted to a 50-kDa protein (p50ATF6) in ER-stressed cells. Furthermore, we showed that the most important consequence of this conversion was altered subcellular localization; p90ATF6 is embedded in the ER, whereas p50ATF6 is a nuclear protein. p90ATF6 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a hydrophobic stretch in the middle of the molecule. Thus, the N-terminal half containing a basic leucine zipper motif is oriented facing the cytoplasm. Full-length ATF6 as well as its C-terminal deletion mutant carrying the transmembrane domain is localized in the ER when transfected. In contrast, mutant ATF6 representing the cytoplasmic region translocates into the nucleus and activates transcription of the endogenous GRP78/BiP gene.

	Abstract = {The UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase is a soluble enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum that glucosylates protein-linked Man7-9GlcNAc2 to form the monoglucosylated derivatives. In vivo the reaction products are immediately deglucosylated by glucosidase II. The glucosyltransferase has a unique property: it glucosylates misfolded, but not native, glycoproteins. It has been proposed that the glucosyltransferase participates, together with calnexin, in the control mechanism by which only properly folded glycoproteins can exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. In this paper it is demonstrated that the glucosyltransferase recognizes two elements in the acceptor substrates: the innermost N-acetylglucosamine unit of the oligosaccharide and protein domains exposed in denatured, but not in native, conformations. Both determinants have to be covalently linked. In many cases the first element is not accessible to macromolecular probes in native conformations. Concerning the protein domains, it is demonstrated here that the glucosyltransferase interacts with hydrophobic amino acids exposed in denatured conformations. More disordered conformations, i.e. those exposing more hydrophobic amino acids, were found to be those having higher glucose acceptor capacity. It is suggested that both accessibility of the innermost N-acetylglucosamine unit and binding to hydrophobic patches determine the exclusive glucosylation of misfolded conformations by the glucosyltransferase.},

	Abstract = {The efficient functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is essential for most cellular activities and survival. Conditions that interfere with ER function lead to the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins. ER transmembrane receptors detect the onset of ER stress and initiate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore normal ER function. If the stress is prolonged, or the adaptive response fails, apoptotic cell death ensues. Many studies have focused on how this failure initiates apoptosis, as ER stress-induced apoptosis is implicated in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we examine the role of the molecules that are activated during the UPR in order to identify the molecular switch from the adaptive phase to apoptosis. We discuss how the activation of these molecules leads to the commitment of death and the mechanisms that are responsible for the final demise of the cell.},

	Abstract = {Brain ischemia induces apoptosis in neuronal cells, but the mechanism is not well understood. When wild-type mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (BCCAO) for 15 min, apoptosis-associated morphological changes and appearance of TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the striatum and in the hippocampus at 48 h after occlusion. RT-PCR analysis revealed that mRNAs for ER stress-associated proapoptotic factor CHOP and an ER chaperone BiP are markedly induced at 12 h after BCCAO. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CHOP protein is induced in nuclei of damaged neurons at 24 h after occlusion. In contrast, ischemia-associated apoptotic loss of neurons was decreased in CHOP(-/-) mice. Primary hippocampal neurons from CHOP(-/-) mice were more resistant to hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced apoptosis than those from wild-type animals. These results indicate that ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is mediated by the ER stress pathway involving CHOP induction.},

	Abstract = {Autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) is caused by mutations in the parkin gene. Parkin protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like domain at its NH(2) terminus and by two RING finger motifs and one IBR (in between RING finger) motif at its COOH-terminus (RING-IBR-RING). We showed that the parkin protein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which binds to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) through its RING-IBR-RING motif. The pathogenesis of AR-JP, therefore, was hypothesized to be accumulation of unidentified neurotoxic protein (a substrate of parkin). On the basis of this hypothesis, the substrate of parkin was sought using a yeast two-hybrid system. A putative G protein-coupled transmembrane polypeptide, named Pael (parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like) receptor, was identified as a parkin binding protein. When overexpressed in cells, this receptor tends to become unfolded, insoluble, and ubiquitinated. The insoluble Pael receptor leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death. Parkin specifically ubiquitinates this receptor in the presence of ER-resident E2s and promotes the degradation of unfolded Pael receptor, resulting in suppression of the cell death induced by the accumulation of unfolded Pael receptor in the ER. Moreover, the insoluble form of Pael receptor accumulates in the brain of AR-JP patients. This protein is highly expressed in the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which is specifically affected in Parkinson's disease; although it is also widely expressed in oligodendroglias in the fiber tract. In conclusion, we showed that the accumulation of unfolded Pael receptor (a substrate of parkin) may cause selective death of dopaminergic neurons in AR-JP.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly organized and specialized organelle optimized for the production of proteins. It is comprised of a highly interconnected network of tubules that contain a large set of resident proteins dedicated to the maturation and processing of proteins that traverse the eukaryotic secretory pathway. As protein maturation is an imperfect process, frequently resulting in misfolding and/or the formation of aggregates, proteins are subjected to a series of evaluation processes within the ER. Proteins deemed native are sorted for anterograde trafficking, while immature or non-native proteins are initially retained in the ER in an attempt to rescue the aberrant products. Terminally misfolded substrates are eventually targeted for turnover through the ER-associated degradation or ERAD pathway to protect the cell from the release of a defective product. A clearer picture of the identity of the machinery involved in these quality control evaluation processes and their mechanisms of actions has emerged over the past decade.},

	Abstract = {We isolated and identified a stress protein that is up-regulated in response to hypoxia in primary-cultured glial cells. Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) was up-regulated not only by hypoxia in glia in vitro, but also by transient forebrain ischemia in rats in vivo. To determine whether newly synthesized PDI is involved in tolerance to ischemic stress, we carried out two procedures to induce PDI gene expression in human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells, as well as intrahippocampal injection following electroporation of an expression vector capable of overexpressing PDI in rats. Overexpression of this gene resulted in attenuation of the loss of cell viability induced by hypoxia in neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells and a reduction in the number of DNA-fragmented cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus in brain ischemic rats, respectively. These findings suggest that up-regulated PDI may play a critical role in resistance to ischemic damage, and that the elevation of levels of this protein in the brain may have beneficial effects against brain stroke.},

	Abstract = {Most early-onset cases of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are linked to mutations in two related genes, ps1 and ps2. FAD-linked mutant PS1 alters proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein and increases vulnerability to apoptosis induced by various cell stresses. In transfected cell lines, mutations in ps1 decrease the unfolded-protein response (UPR), which is the response to the increased amounts of unfolded proteins that accumulate in the endoplamic reticulum (ER), indicating that these mutations may increase vulnerability to ER stress by altering the UPR signalling pathway. Here we report that, in primary cultured neurons from cortices of transgenic mice, overexpression of mutated PS1 (M146L mutation) but not PS1 wild-type (wt) enhanced spontaneous neuronal apoptosis that involved oxidative stress and caspase activation. In PS1M146L cultures, neurons displaying immunoreactivity for human PS1 were threefold more vulnerable to spontaneous apoptosis than the overall neuronal population. In addition, PS1M146L transgenic neurons were more sensitive to apoptosis induced by various stresses, including two ER-Golgi toxins, nordihydroguaiatric acid and brefeldin A (also known to induce UPR), as well as staurosporine. In contrast, PS1 wt transgenic neurons were resistant to apoptosis induced by Golgi-ER toxins but displayed a comparable vulnerability to staurosporine. Our study demonstrates that, as previously reported, overexpression of FAD-linked mutant PS1 enhances neuronal vulnerability to spontaneous and induced apoptosis. In addition, we show that this vulnerability was correlated with mutant PS1 protein expression and that PS1 wt overexpression selectively prevented ER-Golgi stress-induced apoptosis. These data indicate that PS1 interferes with a specific apoptotic pathway that results from a dysfunction of the ER-Golgi compartment.},

	Abstract = {Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses that reduce ER protein folding activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). One effector of the UPR is the transcription factor X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1), which is expressed on ER stress-mediated splicing of the XBP1 mRNA. XBP1 induces certain ER-targeted proteins, eg, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), that help resolve the ER stress and foster cell survival. In this study, we determined whether hypoxia can activate the UPR in the cardiac context. Neonatal rat ventricular myocyte cultures subjected to hypoxia (16 hours) exhibited increased XBP1 mRNA splicing, XBP1 protein expression, GRP78 promoter activation, and GRP78 protein levels; however, the levels of these UPR markers declined during reoxygenation, suggesting that the UPR is activated during hypoxia but not during reoxygenation. When cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus (AdV) encoding dominant-negative XBP1 (AdV-XBP1dn), UPR markers were reduced; however, hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis increased. Confocal immunocytofluorescence demonstrated that hypoxia induced GRP78 in neonatal rat and isolated adult mouse ventricular myocytes. Moreover, mouse hearts subjected to in vivo myocardial infarction exhibited increased GRP78 expression in cardiac myocytes near the infarct, but not in healthy cells distal to the infarct. These results indicate that hypoxia activates the UPR in cardiac myocytes and that XBP1-inducible proteins may contribute to protecting the myocardium during hypoxic stress.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-transmembrane proteins, ATF6 alpha and ATF6 beta, are cleaved during the ER stress response (ERSR). The resulting N-terminal fragments (N-ATF6 alpha and N-ATF6 beta) have conserved DNA-binding domains and divergent transcriptional activation domains. N-ATF6 alpha and N-ATF6 beta translocate to the nucleus, bind to specific regulatory elements, and influence expression of ERSR genes, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), that contribute to resolving the ERSR, thus, enhancing cell viability. We previously showed that N-ATF6 alpha is a rapidly degraded, strong transcriptional activator, whereas beta is a slowly degraded, weak activator. In this study we explored the molecular basis and functional impact of these isoform-specific characteristics in HeLa cells. Mutants in the transcriptional activation domain or DNA-binding domain of N-ATF6 alpha exhibited loss of function and increased expression, the latter of which suggested decreased rates of degradation. Fusing N-ATF6 alpha to the mutant estrogen receptor generated N-ATF6 alpha-MER, which, without tamoxifen exhibited loss-of-function and high expression, but in the presence of tamoxifen N-ATF6 alpha-MER exhibited gain-of-function and low expression. N-ATF6 beta conferred loss-of-function and high expression to N-ATF6 alpha, suggesting that ATF6 beta is an endogenous inhibitor of ATF6 alpha. In vitro DNA binding experiments showed that recombinant N-ATF6 beta inhibited the binding of recombinant N-ATF6 alpha to an ERSR element from the GRP78 promoter. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knock-down of endogenous ATF6 beta increased GRP78 promoter activity and GRP78 gene expression, as well as augmenting cell viability. Thus, the relative levels of ATF6 alpha and -beta, may contribute to regulating the strength and duration of ATF6-dependent ERSR gene induction and cell viability.},

	Abstract = {Eukaryotes respond to the presence of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by up-regulating the transcription of genes encoding ER protein chaperones, such as BiP. We have isolated a novel human cDNA encoding a homolog to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ire1p, a proximal sensor for this signal transduction pathway in yeast. The gene product hIre1p is a type 1 transmembrane protein containing a cytoplasmic domain that is highly conserved to the yeast counterpart having a Ser/Thr protein kinase domain and a domain homologous to RNase L. However, the luminal domain has extensively diverged from the yeast gene product. hIre1p expressed in mammalian cells displayed intrinsic autophosphorylation activity and an endoribonuclease activity that cleaved the 5' splice site of yeast HAC1 mRNA, a substrate for the endoribonuclease activity of yeast Ire1p. Overexpressed hIre1p was localized to the ER with particular concentration around the nuclear envelope and some colocalization with the nuclear pore complex. Expression of Ire1p mRNA was autoregulated through a process that required a functional hIre1p kinase activity. Finally, overexpression of wild-type hIre1p constitutively activated a reporter gene under transcriptional control of the rat BiP promoter, whereas expression of a catalytically inactive hIre1p acted in a trans-dominant-negative manner to prevent transcriptional activation of the BiP promoter in response to ER stress induced by inhibition of N-linked glycosylation. These results demonstrate that hIre1p is an essential proximal sensor of the unfolded protein response pathway in mammalian cells.},

	Abstract = {The mammalian and yeast unfolded protein responses (UPR) share the characteristic of rapid elimination of unspliced Xbp-1 (Xbp-1u) and unspliced Hac1p, respectively. These polypeptides derive from mRNAs, whose splicing is induced upon onset of the UPR, so as to allow synthesis of transcription factors essential for execution of the UPR itself. Whereas in yeast translation of unspliced Hac1p is blocked, mammalian Xbp-1u is synthesized constitutively and eliminated by rapid proteasomal degradation. Here we show that the rate of Xbp-1u degradation approaches its rate of synthesis. The C terminus of XBP-1u ensures its trafficking to the cytoplasm, and is sufficient to impose rapid degradation. Degradation of XBP-1u involves both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent mechanisms, which might explain its unusually rapid turnover. Xbp-1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts reconstituted with mutants of XBP-1u that show improved stability differentially activate UPR target genes. Unexpectedly, we found that one of the mutants activates transcription of both Xbp-1-specific and non-Xbp-1-dependent UPR targets in response to tunicamycin treatment, even more potently than does wild type Xbp-1. We suggest that the degradation of Xbp-1u is required to prevent uncontrolled activation of the UPR while allowing short dwell times for initiation of this response.},

However, the roles of JNK and p38 signaling pathways during apoptosis have been controversial. Here we show that by deleting ASK1 in mice, TNF- and H(2)O(2)-induced sustained activations of JNK and p38 are lost in ASK1(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts, and that ASK1(-/-) cells are resistant to TNF- and H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. TNF- but not Fas-induced apoptosis requires ROS-dependent activation of ASK1-JNK/p38 pathways. Thus, ASK1 is selectively required for TNF- and oxidative stress-induced sustained activations of JNK/p38 and apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a MAPKKK family member which activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. In non-stressed cells, ASK1 exists as an inactive complex with the reduced form of thioredoxin. Oxidative stress such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) disrupts the ASK1-thioredoxin complex by oxidization of thioredoxin and thereby activates ASK1. The precise mechanism by which ASK1 is activated after its release from thioredoxin is unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of Thr845 at the activation loop is essential for ASK1 to be activated by H2O2. ASK1 appears to form a silent homo-oligomer through its C-terminal coiled-coil region in non-stressed cells. Following H2O2 treatment, pre-existing ASK1 oligomer undergoes conformational change and creates a new interface within an oligomer, which ultimately leads to trans-autophosphorylation of Thr845. Thus, direct interaction via the coiled-coil region is required for self-scaffolding but not sufficient for activation of ASK1. Importantly, Thr845 of ASK1 can also be trans-phosphorylated by an unidentified Thr845 kinase in response to H2O2 treatment. We propose that this potential Thr845 kinase may be an ignition kinase that triggers Thr845 phosphorylation in oligomerized and activation-competent forms of ASK1.},

Such fidelity is maintained by quality control (QC) mechanisms that avoid the production of nonnative structures. QC relies on chaperone systems in the ER that monitor and assist in the folding process. When folding promotion is not sufficient, proteins are retained in the ER and eventually retranslocated to the cytosol for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Retention of proteins that fail QC can sometimes occur beyond the ER, and degradation can take place in lysosomes. Several diseases are associated with proteins that do not pass QC, fail to be degraded efficiently, and accumulate as aggregates. In other cases, pathology arises from the downregulation of mutated but potentially functional proteins that are retained and degraded by the QC system.},

Deltalhs1 mutant cells are viable but are constitutively induced for the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here, we demonstrate a severe growth defect in Deltaire1Deltalhs1 double mutant cells in which the UPR can no longer be induced. In addition, we have identified a UPR- regulated gene, SIL1, whose overexpression is sufficient to suppress the Deltaire1Deltalhs1 growth defect. SIL1 encodes an ER-localized protein that interacts directly with the ATPase domain of Kar2p (BiP), suggesting some role in modulating the activity of this vital chaperone. SIL1 is a non-essential gene but the Deltalhs1Deltasil1 double mutation is lethal and correlates with a complete block of protein translocation into the ER. We conclude that the IRE1-dependent induction of SIL1 is a vital adaptation in Deltalhs1 cells, and that the activities associated with the Lhs1 and Sil1 proteins constitute an essential function required for protein translocation into the ER. The Sil1 protein appears widespread amongst eukaryotes, with homologues in Yarrowia lipolytica (Sls1p), Drosophila and mammals.},

	Abstract = {Prion diseases and Alzheimer disease (AD) share a variety of clinical and neuropathologic features (e.g. progressive dementia, accumulation of abnormally folded proteins in diseased tissue, and pronounced neuronal loss) as well as pathogenic mechanisms like generation of oxidative stress molecules and complement activation. Recently, it was suggested that neuronal death in AD may have its origin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Cellular stress conditions can interfere with protein folding and subsequently cause accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. The ER responds to this by the activation of adaptive pathways, which are termed unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR transducer PERK, which launches the most immediate response to ER stress (i.e. the transient attenuation of mRNA translation), and the downstream effector of PERK, eIF2alpha, were shown to be activated in AD. We demonstrate that neither in sporadic nor in infectiously acquired or inherited human prion diseases can the activated forms of PERK and eIF2alpha be detected, except when concomitant neurofibrillary pathology is present; whereas the distribution of phosphorylated PERK correlates with abnormally phosphorylated tau in AD. In brains of scrapie-affected mice and mice infected with sporadic or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, activated PERK is only very faintly expressed. The lack of prominent activation of the PERK-eIF2alpha pathway in prion diseases suggests that, in contrast to AD, ER stress does not play a crucial role in neuronal death in prion disorders.},

The discovery of diseases that are associated with ERAD substrates highlights the importance of this pathway.

	Abstract = {Increase in free intracellular calcium [Ca 2+]i plays a crucial role in cardiomyocyte ischemic injury. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of the sarcoplasmic-reticulum stress-protein Grp94 reduces myocyte necrosis due to calcium overload or simulated ischemia. Selective three- to eightfold Grp94 increase, with no change in Grp78 or calreticulin amount, was achieved by stable transfection of skeletal C2C12 and cardiac H9c2 muscle cells. After exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187, LDH release from five different Grp94-overexpressing clones of either C2C12 and H9c2 origin was significantly lower than that of control ones and [Ca 2+]i increase was significantly delayed. The number of necrotic cells, evaluated by propidium iodide uptake, was reduced when cells from the Grp94-overexpressing H9c2 clone were exposed to conditions simulating ischemia. Experiments performed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes co-transfected with grp94 and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNAs validated the protective effect of Grp94 overexpression. A lower percentage of propidium-iodide positive/GFP-fluorescent myocytes co-expressing exogenous Grp94, with respect to myocytes expressing GFP alone, was observed after exposure to either A23187 (6.6\% vs. 14.0\%, respectively) or simulated ischemia (8.5\% vs. 17.7\%, respectively). In conclusion, the selective increase in Grp94 protects cardiomyocytes from both ischemia and calcium overload counteracting [Ca 2+]i elevations.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Aberrant microenvironment and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are associated with solid-tumor progression. Stress proteins, like heat shock proteins and glucose-regulated proteins, are frequently overexpressed in human tumors. It has been reported that derlin-1 is involved in ER stress response. In vitro studies have demonstrated that derlin-1 participates in the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from ER into the cytosol. Because the roles of derlin-1 in human cancer have not yet been characterized, we investigated the expression of derlin-1 in human breast carcinoma and whether it protected cancer cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis. METHODS: Surgical specimens of human breast cancer and/or paired normal tissues from the same patients were collected for immunohistochemical and/or Western blot analysis with anti-human derlin-1 antibody. The expression of derlin-1 in human breast cancer cell lines was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. A synthetic small interfering RNA against derlin-1 was introduced into breast cancer cells to inhibit derlin-1 expression. The effects of derlin-1 knockdown on ER stress-induced apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: These analyses demonstrated that 66.7\% of the breast carcinoma tissues expressed derlin-1, whereas derlin-1 was rarely expressed in normal mammary glands. The expression of derlin-1 in human breast carcinoma correlated with tumor grade and axillary lymph node metastasis. On examining the expression of derlin-1 in human breast cancer cell lines, we found that derlin-1 expression was enhanced by ER stress-inducing agents. Derlin-1 knockdown sensitized breast cancer cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The observed derlin-1 overexpression in breast cancer, together with its function in relieving ER stress-induced apoptosis, suggests that regulation of the ER stress response pathway may be critical in the development and progression of breast cancer.},

	Abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases are often associated with dysfunction in protein quality control. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a key site for protein synthesis, senses stressful conditions by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). In this study we report the creation of a novel mouse model in which GRP78/BiP, a major ER chaperone and master regulator of UPR, is specifically eliminated in Purkinje cells (PCs). GRP78-depleted PCs activate UPR including the induction of GRP94, PDI, CHOP and GADD34, feedback suppression of eIF2alpha phosphorylation and apoptotic cell death. In contrast to current models of protein misfolding in which an abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated protein is prominent, cytosolic ubiquitin staining is dramatically reduced in GRP78-null PCs. Ultrastructural evaluation reveals that the ER shows prominent dilatation with focal accumulation of electron-dense material within the ER. The mice show retarded growth and severe motor coordination defect by week 5 and cerebellar atrophy by week 13. Our studies uncover a novel link between GRP78 depletion and reduction in cytosolic ubiquitination and establish a novel mouse model of accelerated cerebellar degeneration with basic and clinical applications.},

In vitro, CHOP is phosphorylated on these residues by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). A specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB203580, abolished the stress-inducible in vivo phosphorylation of CHOP. Phosphorylation of CHOP on these residues enhanced its ability to function as a transcriptional activator and was also required for the full inhibitory effect of CHOP on adipose cell differentiation.

	Abstract = {Cells modify their gene expression pattern in response to stress signals emanating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The well-characterized aspect of this response consists of the activation of genes that encode protein chaperones and other ER resident proteins, and is conserved between mammals and yeast. In mammalian cells, however, ER stress also activates other pathways, including the expression of the transcription factor CHOP/GADD153 and its downstream target genes. ER stress is also linked to the development of programmed cell death, a phenomenon in which CHOP plays an important role. Here we report on the cloning of a murine homolog of yeast IRE1, an essential upstream component of the ER stress-response in yeast. The mammalian Ire1 is located in the ER membrane and its over-expression in mammalian cells activates both the endogenous ER chaperone GRP78/BiP and CHOP-encoding genes. Over-expression of a dominant-negative form of Ire1 blocks the induction of GRP78/BiP and CHOP in response to the ER stress induced by tunicamycin treatment. Over-expression of murine Ire1 also leads to the development of programmed cell death in transfected cells. These results indicate that a single upstream component, Ire1, plays a role in multiple facets of the ER stress-response in mammalian cells.},

Calcineurin was found to dephosphorylate BAD, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, thus enhancing BAD heterodimerization with Bcl-xL and promoting apoptosis. The Ca2+-induced dephosphorylation of BAD correlated with its dissociation from 14-3-3 in the cytosol and translocation to mitochondria where Bcl-xL resides. In hippocampal neurons, L-glutamate, an inducer of Ca2+ influx and calcineurin activation, triggered mitochondrial targeting of BAD and apoptosis, which were both suppressible by coexpression of a dominant-inhibitory mutant of calcineurin or pharmacological inhibitors of this phosphatase. Thus, a Ca2+-inducible mechanism for apoptosis induction operates by regulating BAD phosphorylation and localization in cells.},

	Abstract = {ATF6 is a member of the basic-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. It contains a transmembrane domain and is located in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. ATF6 has been implicated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway since it can activate expression of GRP78 and other genes induced by the ER stress response. ER stress appears to activate ATF6 by cleavage from the ER membrane and translocation to the nucleus. However, direct DNA binding by ATF6 had not been demonstrated. In this report, we have identified a consensus DNA binding sequence for ATF6. This site is related to but distinct from ATF1/CREB binding sites. The site was placed in a reporter gene and was specifically activated by ATF6 overexpression and was strongly induced by the ER stress response. A dominant negative form of ATF6 blocked ER stress induction of both ATF6 site and GRP78 reporter genes. We further found that GAL4-ATF6 could be activated by ER stress. These results demonstrate that ATF6 is a direct target of the ER stress response. A proximal sensor of the ER stress response, human IRE1 (hIRE1), was sufficient to activate the ATF6 reporter gene, while a dominant negative form of hIRE1 blocked ER stress activation, suggesting that hIRE1 is upstream of ATF6 in the ER stress signaling pathway.},

	Abstract = {Calnexin is a molecular chaperone that resides in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Most proteins that calnexin binds are N-glycosylated, and treatment of cells with tunicamycin or inhibitors of initial glucose trimming steps interferes with calnexin binding. To test if calnexin is a lectin that binds early oligosaccharide processing intermediates, a recombinant soluble calnexin was created. Incubation of soluble calnexin with a mixture of Glc0-3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides resulted in specific binding of the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 species. Furthermore, Glc1Man5-7GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides bound relatively poorly, suggesting that, in addition to a requirement for the single terminal glucose residue, at least one of the terminal mannose residues was important for binding. To assess the involvement of oligosaccharide-protein interactions in complexes of calnexin and newly synthesized glycoproteins, alpha 1-antitrypsin or the heavy chain of the class I histocompatibility molecule were purified as complexes with calnexin and digested with endoglycosidase H. All oligosaccharides on either glycoprotein were accessible to this probe and could be removed without disrupting the association with calnexin. Furthermore, the addition of 1 M alpha-methyl glucoside or alpha-methyl mannoside had no effect on complex stability. These findings suggest that once complexes between calnexin and glycoproteins are formed, oligosaccharide binding does not contribute significantly to the overall interaction. However, it is likely that the binding of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides is a crucial event during the initial recognition of newly synthesized glycoproteins by calnexin.},

	Abstract = {Starvation induces autophagy to preserve cellular homeostasis in virtually all eukaryotic organisms. However, the mechanisms by which starvation induces autophagy are not completely understood. In mammalian cells, the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, binds to Beclin 1 during nonstarvation conditions and inhibits its autophagy function. Here we show that starvation induces phosphorylation of cellular Bcl-2 at residues T69, S70, and S87 of the nonstructured loop; Bcl-2 dissociation from Beclin 1; and autophagy activation. In contrast, viral Bcl-2, which lacks the phosphorylation site-containing nonstructured loop, fails to dissociate from Beclin 1 during starvation. Furthermore, the stress-activated signaling molecule, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1), but not JNK2, mediates starvation-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation, Bcl-2 dissociation from Beclin 1, and autophagy activation. Together, our findings demonstrate that JNK1-mediated multisite phosphorylation of Bcl-2 stimulates starvation-induced autophagy by disrupting the Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complex. These findings define a mechanism that cells use to regulate autophagic activity in response to nutrient status.},

We find that cells lacking both Bax and Bak, but not cells lacking only one of these components, are completely resistant to tBID-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Moreover, doubly deficient cells are resistant to multiple apoptotic stimuli that act through disruption of mitochondrial function: staurosporine, ultraviolet radiation, growth factor deprivation, etoposide, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress stimuli thapsigargin and tunicamycin. Thus, activation of a "multidomain" proapoptotic member, BAX or BAK, appears to be an essential gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction required for cell death in response to diverse stimuli.},

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the putative transmembrane receptor kinase, Ire1p (Ern1p), has been implicated as the sensor of unfolded proteins in the ER that initiates transmittance of the unfolded protein signal from the ER to the nucleus. We have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of Ire1p receptor indeed has intrinsic Ser/Thr kinase activity and contains Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites as well. The cytoplasmic domain is also shown to form oligomers in vivo and in vitro. The ability to form oligomers primarily resides within the last 130 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, a region that is dispensable for in vitro kinase activity of the receptor. Oligomerization of the cytoplasmic domains is required for receptor trans-phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase function. The activated kinase may transmit the unfolded protein signal from the ER to the nucleus to activate the transcription of the chaperone genes in the nucleus.},

	Abstract = {In vertebrates, three proteins--PERK, IRE1alpha, and ATF6alpha--sense protein-misfolding stress in the ER and initiate ER-to-nucleus signaling cascades to improve cellular function. The mechanism by which this unfolded protein response (UPR) protects ER function during stress is not clear. To address this issue, we have deleted Atf6alpha in the mouse. ATF6alpha is neither essential for basal expression of ER protein chaperones nor for embryonic or postnatal development. However, ATF6alpha is required in both cells and tissues to optimize protein folding, secretion, and degradation during ER stress and thus to facilitate recovery from acute stress and tolerance to chronic stress. Challenge of Atf6alpha null animals in vivo compromises organ function and survival despite functional overlap between UPR sensors. These results suggest that the vertebrate ATF6alpha pathway evolved to maintain ER function when cells are challenged with chronic stress and provide a rationale for the overlap among the three UPR pathways.},

Moreover, BI-1 can interact with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL but Bax or Bak, as demonstrated by in vivo cross-linking and coimmunoprecipitation studies. When overexpressed in mammalian cells, BI-1 suppressed apoptosis included by Bax, etoposide, staurosporine, and growth factor deprivation, but not by Fas (CD95). Conversely, BI-1 antisense induced apoptosis. BI-1 thus represents a new type of regulator of cell death pathways controlled by Bcl-2 and Bax.},

	Abstract = {Wolfram syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, is caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene encoding an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein. Herein, we report that pancreatic islets of wfs1-deficient mice exhibit increases in phosphorylation of RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase, chaperone gene expressions and active XBP1 protein levels, indicating an enhanced ER stress response. We established wfs1-deficient MIN6 clonal beta-cells by crossing wfs1-deficient mice with mice expressing simian virus 40 large T antigen in beta-cells. These cells show essentially the same alterations in ER stress responses as wfs1-deficient islets, which were reversed by re-expression of WFS1 protein or overexpression of GRP78, a master regulator of the ER stress response. In contrast, these changes are not observed in heart, skeletal muscle or brown adipose tissues with WFS1-deficiency. The increased ER stress response was accompanied by reduced BrdU incorporation and increased caspase-3 cleavage, indicating impaired cell cycle progression and accelerated apoptotic processes in the mutant islets. These changes are associated with increased expression of the cell cycle regulator p21(CIP1) in wfs1-deficient islets and clonal beta-cells. Treatment of islets with thapsigargin, an ER stress inducer, caused upregulation of p21(CIP1). In addition, forced expression of p21(CIP1) resulted in reduced MIN6 beta-cell numbers, suggesting the ER stress-induced increase in p21(CIP1) expression to be involved in beta-cell loss in the mutant islets. These data indicate that WFS1-deficiency activates the ER stress response specifically in beta-cells, causing beta-cell loss through impaired cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Multiple signal transduction pathways are capable of modifying BCL-2 family members to reset susceptibility to apoptosis. We used two-dimensional peptide mapping and sequencing to identify three residues (Ser70, Ser87, and Thr69) within the unstructured loop of BCL-2 that were phosphorylated in response to microtubule-damaging agents, which also arrest cells at G(2)/M. Changing these sites to alanine conferred more antiapoptotic activity on BCL-2 following physiologic death signals as well as paclitaxel, indicating that phosphorylation is inactivating. An examination of cycling cells enriched by elutriation for distinct phases of the cell cycle revealed that BCL-2 was phosphorylated at the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. G(2)/M-phase cells proved more susceptible to death signals, and phosphorylation of BCL-2 appeared to be responsible, as a Ser70Ala substitution restored resistance to apoptosis. We noted that ASK1 and JNK1 were normally activated at G(2)/M phase, and JNK was capable of phosphorylating BCL-2. Expression of a series of wild-type and dominant-negative kinases indicated an ASK1/Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1) pathway phosphorylated BCL-2 in vivo. Moreover, the combination of dominant negative ASK1, (dnASK1), dnMKK7, and dnJNK1 inhibited paclitaxel-induced BCL-2 phosphorylation. Thus, stress response kinases phosphorylate BCL-2 during cell cycle progression as a normal physiologic process to inactivate BCL-2 at G(2)/M.},

ATF6 is an ER membrane-bound transcription factor activated by ER stress-induced proteolysis and has been duplicated in mammals. Here, we generated ATF6alpha- and ATF6beta-knockout mice, which developed normally, and then found that their double knockout caused embryonic lethality. Analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in ATF6alpha or ATF6beta revealed that ATF6alpha is solely responsible for transcriptional induction of ER chaperones and that ATF6alpha heterodimerizes with XBP1 for the induction of ER-associated degradation components. ATF6alpha(-/-) MEFs are sensitive to ER stress. Unaltered responses observed in ATF6beta(-/-) MEFs indicate that ATF6beta is not a negative regulator of ATF6alpha. These results demonstrate that ATF6alpha functions as a critical regulator of ER quality control proteins in mammalian cells, in marked contrast to worm and fly cells in which IRE1 is responsible.},

	Abstract = {P58(IPK) is an Hsp40 family member known to inhibit the interferon (IFN)-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated, eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) protein kinase R (PKR) by binding to its kinase domain. We find that the stress of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates P58(IPK) gene transcription through an ER stress-response element in its promoter region. P58(IPK) interacts with and inhibits the PKR-like ER-localized eIF2alpha kinase PERK, which is normally activated during the ER-stress response to protect cells from ER stress by attenuating protein synthesis and reducing ER client protein load. Levels of phosphorylated eIF2alpha were lower in ER-stressed P58(IPK)-overexpressing cells and were enhanced in P58(IPK) mutant cells. In the ER-stress response, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK)-mediated translational repression is transient and is followed by translational recovery and enhanced expression of genes that increase the capacity of the ER to process client proteins. The absence of P58(IPK) resulted in increased expression levels of two ER stress-inducible genes, BiP and Chop, consistent with the enhanced eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the P58(IPK) deletion cells. Our studies suggest that P58(IPK) induction during the ER-stress response represses PERK activity and plays a functional role in the expression of downstream markers of PERK activity in the later phase of the ER-stress response.},

	Abstract = {ATF6 is a membrane-bound transcription factor that activates genes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. When unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, ATF6 is cleaved to release its cytoplasmic domain, which enters the nucleus. Here, we show that ATF6 is processed by Site-1 protease (S1P) and Site-2 protease (S2P), the enzymes that process SREBPs in response to cholesterol deprivation. ATF6 processing was blocked completely in cells lacking S2P and partially in cells lacking S1P. ATF6 processing required the RxxL and asparagine/proline motifs, known requirements for S1P and S2P processing, respectively. Cells lacking S2P failed to induce GRP78, an ATF6 target, in response to ER stress. ATF6 processing did not require SCAP, which is essential for SREBP processing. We conclude that S1P and S2P are required for the ER stress response as well as for lipid synthesis.},

	Abstract = {When accumulation of a malfolded protein in the endoplastic reticulum (ER) is induced by various adverse conditions, such as hypoxia, glucose starvation, and perturbation of calcium homeostasis, cells respond to the stress by increasing transcription of genes encoding ER molecular chaperones, a process known as unfolded protein response. The signaling is initiated by IRE1s, ER stress sensors. Alternatively, excessive stress to the ER results in apoptosis. Caspase-12 is known to be essential for this ER stress-induced apoptosis. In this study, we analyzed the detailed regulatory mechanisms of IRE1s during ER stress. We identified c-Jun N-terminal inhibitory kinase (JIK) as a binding partner of IRE1alpha, and JIK was seen to modulate IRE1alpha-TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2) complex formation and the resultant alteration to c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling from IRE1s in response to ER stress. We also demonstrated that TRAF2 interacts with procaspase-12 and promotes the clustering of procaspase-12 and its activation by cleavage in response to ER stress. These results indicate that TRAF2 plays crucial roles not only in the signaling of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway but also in activation of caspase-12 to transduce signals from IRE1s. Thus, we provide a missing link in the ER stress-induced apoptosis-signaling pathway, one which connects the stress sensor molecule IRE1 and the activation of caspase-12.},

Autophagy is a catabolic process for the degradation and recycling of cytosolic, long lived, or aggregated proteins and excess or defective organelles. In this study, we demonstrate a new pathway for the induction of autophagy. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), accumulation of misfolded proteins causes stress and activates the unfolded protein response to induce the expression of chaperones and proteins involved in the recovery process. ER stress stimulated the assembly of the pre-autophagosomal structure. In addition, autophagosome formation and transport to the vacuole were stimulated in an Atg protein-dependent manner. Finally, Atg1 kinase activity reflects both the nutritional status and autophagic state of the cell; starvation-induced autophagy results in increased Atg1 kinase activity. We found that Atg1 had high kinase activity during ER stress-induced autophagy. Together, these results indicate that ER stress can induce an autophagic response.},

The transcription factor protein (p) XBP1 spliced (S), which is translated from mature XBP1 mRNA, contains the nuclear localization signal and the transcriptional activation domain and activates the transcription of target genes, including those encoding ER chaperones in the nucleus. We show that pXBP1 unspliced (U) encoded in XBP1 pre-mRNA was constitutively expressed and markedly accumulated at the recovery phase of ER stress. pXBP1(U) contained the nuclear exclusion signal instead of the transcriptional activation domain and shuttled between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Interestingly, pXBP1(U) formed a complex with pXBP1(S), and the pXBP1(U)-pXBP1(S) complex was sequestered from the nucleus. Moreover, the complex was rapidly degraded by proteasomes because of the degradation motif contained in pXBP1(U). Thus, pXBP1(U) is a negative feedback regulator of pXBP1(S), which shuts off the transcription of target genes during the recovery phase of ER stress.},

	Abstract = {Cells from yeast to humans activate unconventional mRNA splicing when unfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) under ER stress conditions. The substrate of this splicing in mammalian cells is XBP1 mRNA, which encodes the unfolded protein response (UPR)-specific transcription factor XBP1. The C-terminal region of XBP1 is switched as a result of the splicing. Thus, unspliced and spliced mRNAs produce pXBP1(U) of 261 aa and pXBP1(S) of 376 aa, respectively, with the N-terminal region containing the DNA-binding domain shared. As the pXBP1(S)-specific C-terminal region functions as an activation domain, pXBP1(S) can activate transcription efficiently. We recently found that pXBP1(U) shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, owing to the presence of a nuclear exclusion signal in the pXBP1(U)-specific C-terminal region, in marked contrast to the exclusively nuclear localization of pXBP1(S). pXBP1(U) can associate with pXBP1(S), and pXBP1(U)-pXBP1(S) complex is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Two other transcription factors are activated in response to ER stress, namely ATF6 and ATF4. ATF6 is a UPR-specific transcription factor, whereas ATF4 is activated by not only ER stress but also various other stimuli. In this study, we show that pXBP1(U) targets the active form of ATF6 but not ATF4 for destruction by the proteasome via direct association. This enhanced degradation is mediated by the degradation domain located at the pXBP1(U)-specific C-terminal end. We conclude that pXBP1(U) functions as a negative regulator of the UPR-specific transcription factors ATF6 and pXBP1(S).},

In contrast to recent progress in the analysis of yeast UPR, both cis-acting elements and transactivators responsible for mammalian UPR have remained obscure. Here, we analyzed the promoter regions of human GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin genes and identified a novel element designated the ER stress response element (ERSE). ERSE, with a consensus of CCAATN9CCACG, was shown to be necessary and sufficient for induction of these GRPs. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, we isolated a human cDNA encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, ATF6, as a putative ERSE-binding protein. When overexpressed in HeLa cells, ATF6 enhanced transcription of GRP genes in an ERSE-dependent manner, whereas CREB-RP, another bZIP protein closely related to ATF6, specifically inhibited GRP induction. Endogenous ATF6 constitutively expressed as a 90-kDa protein was converted to a 50-kDa protein in ER-stressed cells, which appeared to be important for the cellular response to ER stress. These results suggest that, as in yeast, bZIP proteins are involved in mammalian UPR, acting through newly defined ERSE.},

This intracellular signaling, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), is mediated by the cis-acting ER stress response element (ERSE) in mammals. In addition to ER chaperones, the mammalian transcription factor CHOP (also called GADD153) is induced by ER stress. We report here that the transcription factor XBP-1 (also called TREB5) is also induced by ER stress and that induction of CHOP and XBP-1 is mediated by ERSE. The ERSE consensus sequence is CCAAT-N(9)-CCACG. As the general transcription factor NF-Y (also known as CBF) binds to CCAAT, CCACG is considered to provide specificity in the mammalian UPR. We recently found that the basic leucine zipper protein ATF6 isolated as a CCACG-binding protein is synthesized as a transmembrane protein in the ER, and ER stress-induced proteolysis produces a soluble form of ATF6 that translocates into the nucleus. We report here that overexpression of soluble ATF6 activates transcription of the CHOP and XBP-1 genes as well as of ER chaperone genes constitutively, whereas overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of ATF6 blocks the induction by ER stress. Furthermore, we demonstrated that soluble ATF6 binds directly to CCACG only when CCAAT exactly 9 bp upstream of CCACG is bound to NF-Y. Based on these and other findings, we concluded that specific and direct interactions between ATF6 and ERSE are critical for transcriptional induction not only of ER chaperones but also of CHOP and XBP-1.},

	Abstract = {Proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are properly folded with the assistance of ER chaperones. Malfolded proteins are disposed of by ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). When the amount of unfolded protein exceeds the folding capacity of the ER, human cells activate a defense mechanism called the ER stress response, which induces expression of ER chaperones and ERAD components and transiently attenuates protein synthesis to decrease the burden on the ER. It has been revealed that three independent response pathways separately regulate induction of the expression of chaperones, ERAD components, and translational attenuation. A malfunction of the ER stress response caused by aging, genetic mutations, or environmental factors can result in various diseases such as diabetes, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and bipolar disorder, which are collectively known as 'conformational diseases'. In this review, I will summarize recent progress in this field. Molecules that regulate the ER stress response would be potential candidates for drug targets in various conformational diseases.},

The MyD116 gene was found to be the murine homolog of the hamster gadd34 gene, whereas MyD118 and gadd45 were found to represent two separate but closely related genes. Furthermore, gadd34/MyD116, gadd45, MyD118, and gadd153 encode acidic proteins with very similar and unusual charge characteristics; both this property and a similar pattern of induction are shared with mdm2, whic, like gadd45, has been shown previously to be regulated by the tumor suppressor p53. Expression analysis revealed that they are distinguished from other growth arrest genes in that they are DNA damage inducible and suggest a role for these genes in growth arrest and apoptosis either coupled with or uncoupled from terminal differentiation. Evidence is also presented for coordinate induction in vivo by stress. The use of a short-term transfection assay, in which expression vectors for one or a combination of these gadd/MyD genes were transfected with a selectable marker into several different human tumor cell lines, provided direct evidence for the growth-inhibitory functions of the products of these genes and their ability to synergistically suppress growth. Taken together, these observations indicate that these genes define a novel class of mammalian genes encoding acidic proteins involved in the control of cellular growth.},

	Abstract = {Previously we have shown that ASK-interacting protein 1 (AIP1, also known as DAB2IP), a novel member of the Ras-GAP protein family, mediates TNF-induced activation of ASK1-JNK signaling pathway. However, the mechanism by which TNF signaling is coupled to AIP1 is not known. Here we show that AIP1 is localized on the plasma membrane in resting endothelial cells (EC) in a complex with TNFR1. TNF binding induces release of AIP1 from TNFR1, resulting in cytoplasmic translocation and concomitant formation of an intracellular signaling complex comprised of TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, and AIPl. A proline-rich region (amino acids 796-807) is critical for maintaining AIP1 in a closed form, which associates with a region of TNFR1 distinct from the death domain, the site of TNFR1 association with TRADD. An AIP1 mutant with deletion of this proline-rich region constitutively binds to TRAF2 and ASK1. A PERIOD-like domain (amino acids 591-719) of AIP1 binds to the intact RING finger of TRAF2, and specifically enhances TRAF2-induced ASK1 activation. At the same time, the binding of AIP1 to TRAF2 inhibits TNF-induced IKK-NF-kappaB signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that AIP1 is a novel transducer in TNF-induced TRAF2-dependent activation of ASK1 that mediates a balance between JNK versus NF-kappaB signaling.},

We have previously shown that homocysteine causes activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and activating transcription factor 3/liver regenerating factor 1 (ATF3/LRF1) and induces apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In this study, the activation of JNK and ATF3 in HUVECs was mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident transmembrane kinase IRE1alpha and beta, which sense and transduce signal of the accumulationj of unfolded proteins in the ER. Moreover, dominant negative mutants of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 and mitogen-activated kinase kinase 4 and 7, as well as antisense ATF3 cDNA, inhibited cell death by homocysteine. These results indicate that the activation of JNK and ATF3 through the ER stress of homocysteine plays a role in the homocysteine-induced cell death. The JNK-ATF3 pathway may be implicated in endothelial cell injury associated with hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia.},

	Abstract = {Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored transcription factors is known to maintain sterol homeostasis and to mediate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here, we identified CREBH as a RIP-regulated liver-specific transcription factor that is cleaved upon ER stress and required to activate expression of acute phase response (APR) genes. Proinflammatory cytokines increase expression of ER membrane-anchored CREBH. In response to ER stress, CREBH is cleaved by site-1 and site-2 proteases to liberate an amino-terminal fragment that transits to the nucleus to activate transcription of the genes encoding serum amyloid P-component (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide activate the UPR and induce cleavage of CREBH in the liver in vivo. Together, our studies delineate a molecular mechanism for activation of an ER-localized transcription factor, CREBH, and reveal an unprecedented link by which ER stress initiates an acute inflammatory response.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for much of a cell's protein synthesis and folding, but it also has an important role in sensing cellular stress. Recently, it has been shown that the endoplasmic reticulum mediates a specific set of intracellular signalling pathways in response to the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, and these pathways are collectively known as the unfolded-protein response. New observations suggest that the unfolded-protein response can initiate inflammation, and the coupling of these responses in specialized cells and tissues is now thought to be fundamental in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. The knowledge gained from this emerging field will aid in the development of therapies for modulating cellular stress and inflammation.},

	Abstract = {CDC25A phosphatase promotes cell cycle progression by activating G(1) cyclin-dependent kinases and has been postulated to be an oncogene because of its ability to cooperate with RAS to transform rodent fibroblasts. In this study, we have identified apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) as a CDC25A-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. ASK1 activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal protein kinase-stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) pathways upon various cellular stresses. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that CDC25A physically associates with ASK1 in mammalian cells, and immunocytochemistry with confocal laser-scanning microscopy showed that these two proteins colocalize in the cytoplasm. The carboxyl terminus of CDC25A binds to a domain of ASK1 adjacent to its kinase domain and inhibits the kinase activity of ASK1, independent of and without effect on the phosphatase activity of CDC25A. This inhibitory action of CDC25A on ASK1 activity involves diminished homo-oligomerization of ASK1. Increased cellular expression of wild-type or phosphatase-inactive CDC25A from inducible transgenes suppresses oxidant-dependent activation of ASK1, p38, and JNK1 and reduces specific sensitivity to cell death triggered by oxidative stress, but not other apoptotic stimuli. Thus, increased expression of CDC25A, frequently observed in human cancers, could contribute to reduced cellular responsiveness to oxidative stress under mitogenic or oncogenic conditions, while it promotes cell cycle progression. These observations propose a mechanism of oncogenic transformation by the dual function of CDC25A on cell cycle progression and stress responses.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium dynamics are critical to cellular functions like pain transmission. Extracellular ATP plays an important role in modulating intracellular calcium levels by interacting with the P2 family of surface receptors. In this study, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling in archetype sensory neurons. The model architecture, which described 90 species connected by 162 interactions, was formulated by aggregating disparate molecular modules from literature. Unlike previous models, only mass action kinetics were used to describe the rate of molecular interactions. Thus, the majority of the 252 unknown model parameters were either association, dissociation or catalytic rate constants. Model parameters were estimated from nine independent data sets taken from multiple laboratories. The training data consisted of both dynamic and steady-state measurements. However, because of the complexity of the calcium network, we were unable to estimate unique model parameters. Instead, we estimated a family or ensemble of probable parameter sets using a multi-objective thermal ensemble method. Each member of the ensemble met an error criterion and was located along or near the optimal trade-off surface between the individual training data sets. The model quantitatively reproduced experimental measurements from dorsal root ganglion neurons as a function of extracellular ATP forcing. Hypothesized architecture linking phosphoinositide regulation with P2X receptor activity explained the inhibition of P2X-mediated current flow by activated metabotropic P2Y receptors. Sensitivity analysis using individual and the whole system outputs suggested which molecular subsystems were most important following P2 activation. Taken together, modeling and analysis of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling generated qualitative insight into the critical interactions controlling ATP induced calcium dynamics. Understanding these critical interactions may prove useful for the design of the next generation of molecular pain management strategies.},

@article{Song:2010ij,
	Abstract = {Mathematical modeling of complex gene expression programs is an emerging tool for understanding disease mechanisms. However, identification of large models sometimes requires training using qualitative, conflicting or even contradictory data sets. One strategy to address this challenge is to estimate experimentally constrained model ensembles using multiobjective optimization. In this study, we used Pareto Optimal Ensemble Techniques (POETs) to identify a family of proof-of-concept signal transduction models. POETs integrate Simulated Annealing (SA) with Pareto optimality to identify models near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We modeled a prototypical-signaling network using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework (64 ODEs in total). The true model was used to generate synthetic immunoblots from which the POET algorithm identified the 117 unknown model parameters. POET generated an ensemble of signaling models, which collectively exhibited population-like behavior. For example, scaled gene expression levels were approximately normally distributed over the ensemble following the addition of extracellular ligand. Also, the ensemble recovered robust and fragile features of the true model, despite significant parameter uncertainty. Taken together, these results suggest that experimentally constrained model ensembles could capture qualitatively important network features without exact parameter information.},
